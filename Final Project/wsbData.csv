2024-04-23 12:46:19,TSLA: Big question for Elon today on earnings day!,"IMO the biggest question for Elon to answer during today‚Äôs earnings will be what is Tesla strategy to counter $20K BYD Chinese cars coming into US soon from Mexican factories?

BYD executives announced on Wednesday the automaker will begin selling its Dolphin Mini electric vehicle (EV) in Mexico at 358800 pesos ($20990).

I have been saying for a long time now Tesla needs a CEO who can focus on the car customers & shareholders instead of X fighting with media and its main customers - the liberals who have almost completely abandoned Tesla. IMO the way things are going Tesla may go down below $125 soon. Long term I‚Äôm still optimistic on Tesla unfortunately it has become one manchild dependent company with a spineless board.

Well I‚Äôll like to give my input.This is a 10 year weekly chart of meta as I chart it up I notice meta has been in a strong up trend since 2023 with no major correction         (pull back). As u can see every time it touches that up trend line it backs off. Meta strong move allowed price to be way above the long and short term moving averages whenever a stock is that far away from its moving averages for this long it checks back completing sequence of a up trend which goes up and down for the most part or a down trend which goes  down and up. With all this things I see as I chart my decision or direction I‚Äôm choosing  for meta is that it has down side to it but who knows? Earnings tomorrow tell me what do you think? Do you have charts to share or even looking at mines I‚Äôll love you take on what you think about where this stock can go ,81,62

2024-04-23 04:48:06,Making the Case for Cabaletta Bio (CABA),"Quick overview of their relevant stats:

Free Float ‚Äì 44.7M
Market Cap ‚Äì $642M
Technology ‚Äì CAR-T therapy

Targets/Indications ‚Äì Lupus Myositis Systemic Sclerosis mucosal pemphigus Vulgaris and Myasthenia Gravis (all of them are scary debilitating diseases).

Runway until mid-26‚Äô and a stated intention to find ‚Äústrategic partnership(s)‚Äù.

Two short-term clinical trial readouts for Lupus (SLE) and Myositis.


The Science:

CAR-T therapies for oncological targets have been all the craze in medicine in the recent past and in particular blood cancers.  It‚Äôs not a new treatment but now it‚Äôs being used to treat indications that are not cancer.  

Cells from the patient are taken in a blood draw.  They are then mixed with a virus that easily infects human cells.  The virus itself does not carry any genetic information of the virus; it carries the genetic information on how to identify and kill a B-cell.  The ‚Äúinfected‚Äù cells that now carry the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù genetic targeting information are then put into a media where they can grow.  Once they reach an optimal population they are put back into the patient.  These ‚ÄúCAR-T‚Äù cells then kill off the problematic B-cells in the patient‚Äôs body for a prolonged period of time and then the patient‚Äôs B-cells repopulate months/years down the road without them engaging in an autoimmune response (attacking/killing the good cells).  

Without sounding like a big salesman for the company (I have no affiliation with the company) there have been striking results published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  It‚Äôs important to note that this Journal has a very high standard of publishing quality data.  They have shown that the ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù (genetic bits that go into the CAR-T cell) will effectively kill off the autoimmune-related B-cells that are hurting the patient and that there will be a ‚Äúdurable‚Äù effect on the patient (+2 years).  The technology was born out of U-Penn and Oxford and they are partnered with WuXi to scale their initial products.


The stock:

With very little news the stock peaked around $25 and change.  It has since flittered back down to the low teens and has been bumping around some support lines.  The usual shorting (21% of free float) but nothing too crazy going on.  The analysts SP forecast range is from $25 - $50.  Their corporate slide deck says that they will have their first clinical readouts for both Lupus and Myositis during the first half of this year and we‚Äôre nearly late-April right now.  They will have a second readout during the second half.  Seeing that the stock has a relatively low float for a non-commercialized biotech any good news would propel the SP and based on the published data so far it seems like a probable positive outcome but yeah Science is tricky sometimes.

I have a handful of near the money July calls but I do believe that it would jack up above $20 on good data.  I may buy a few far out of the money calls in July too if the data haven‚Äôt been released in early June.

2024-04-23 04:40:56,Donald Trump set to receive $1.25 billion worth of Trump Media stock in DJT earnout bonus.,"Donald Trump set to receive $1.25 billion worth of Trump Media stock in DJT earnout bonus.

Trump Media which owns the Truth Social app was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.
April 222024

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna148847

Former President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday ‚Äî an ‚Äúearnout‚Äù bonus worth more than $1.25 billion at Monday‚Äôs price.

That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period beginning March 252024.

Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price of $17.50 per share by the end of that day.

The 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns as the company‚Äôs majority shareholder.
Total of 114.75 million shares.

When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock Trump‚Äôs total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper at $35 a share.

The merged company whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 262024 at an opening price of $70.90 per share.

That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion.

Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT) is now $35.50 per share.

52 week high of $79.38
was on TuesdayMarch 262024.
First day of trading under new name and stock symbol.

52 week low $12.40

The greatest show on Earth.

So let‚Äôs look back a little to understand more.

Trump Media stock jumps as much as 50% after DJT ticker debut
TuesdayMarch 262024

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/03/26/trump-media-stock-ticker-djt-debuts-after-dwac-merger.html
 
This stock has had 4 major runs in 2024 lasting from 6 to 22 days.
Obviouslyfrom all this recent activitythis stock is nowhere near finished for 2024.

Plan accordingly.
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see at least 3 more runs before November 2024.

Trump stock and options are nowhere near finished.Not with an additional 36 million more shares for Trump.Not with an election coming up.

2024-04-23 01:51:28,About that Falling Knife - Tesla,"It's time boys and girls. Earnings season is back and there is one sharp knife in the collection. TSLA. Yep the price action on this is insane towards the $150 April 26th puts. 

Who here has leveraged their house on a third HELOC at 9.66% to buy into the downside of this fantastic firesale? I know I have. 

Nothing can stop this train wreck to coming to a completion after tomorrow's earnings. 

What wild and crazy thing with Elon say that can save this ship from an impending port side collapse? 

Look no further than previous earnings calls to get a load of what might be in store. 

>If interest rates come down quickly I think margins will be good and if they don't come down quickly they won't be that good"" he said. ""We have lots of people who want to buy our car but simply can't afford it. 

I don't know Mr. Musk Ford motor company is offering the Mach E for 0.00 apr financing for 72 months. Interest rates aren't coming down anytime soon so the notion that Musk can call out to full year guidance isn't even a realistic thing. Interest rates aren't coming down at all so kiss those margin lips goodbye. 

What's crazy is why wouldn't he offer 0.00% financing considering when you buy a Tesla you lose about 30% in value as soon as you drive it off the lot. 

 What about this doozy of a foresight 

>It's a longshot worth taking because the payoff potential is very high but it's not a sure thing at all. It's a high-risk high-payoff program"" Musk said. ""Dojo is working and it is doing training jobs; we are scaling it up and we have plans for Dojo 1.5 Dojo 2 and Dojo 3. It's got potential but can't emphasize enough: high risk high payoff. 

I don't know Jensen Huang said he has this ready for any car company to develop and tailor to their needs. All they have to do is buy the ""chips"". 

[Nvidia Drive](https://preview.redd.it/e64uokb6t4wc1.png?width=1537&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbcc23c246f35290643393cc6d021d4df14fde7b)

Nvidia drive is getting trained by synthetic data in a digital twin. All that data capturing by Tesla owners will be nothing compared to the endless synthetic situations that can train the Nvidia drive platform along with data capture. 

The point is Robotaxis aren't going to be a only Tesla thing. They will be an entire automotive autonomous driving thing for many players. 

This is devastating because while Mr. Musk may mention Robotaxis 1000 times on this earnings call it will ring hollow to the rest of the industry listening. Yeah we can do that too. 

And all of that is before 1 law even allows Robotaxis to exist in the first place. Look for that legislation to pass in 2030 in the shortest period possible once they prove this technology won't kill people. 

But there's more

Tesla is building robots too and they should be ready next year. Again Jensen Huang just eating that lunch. See here's a thing that some of you didn't know. Story time. Once upon a time Elon invested in a company called OpenAI. After some infighting arguing and things happening Elong decided to give OpenAI and ultimatum if they wanted to continue to exist. He told them to fold OpenAI into Tesla and they were like Nah bro we good. 

In a big brain smooth move Elon said ok and peaced out.

So the thing that could power Optimus's brain in the best way is not at Tesla. It's at Microsoft. Good one Elon.  

>After spending the past year teasing continuous upgrades to Tesla's Optimus project Musk said that the company has a chance of shipping ""some number of Optimus units next year.""¬†  
>  
>Calling it a ""revolutionary"" product Musk said that Optimus ""has the potential to far exceed the value of everything else at Tesla combined.""

So what does it all mean? If you ask me I say the chickens are coming home to roost. 

If Tesla can't maintain the last blockade of selling pressure of $138 - $135 the dam will break and this stock goes to $100 in a matter of weeks. 

Matter of weeks? Mmm maybe a matter of days. 

In the end it was just a car company. Do I think this is the end of Tesla? No I think it's a great company. It may just be time for a leadership change and a massive investment in charging stations with a 0.00% apr buy down so they can sell units and FSD. 

I do think they can turn things around but let's be clear. There is no amount of fairy dust Musk can put on this pig in the short term. He's going to have to work his way out of it. The competition is fierce and the headwinds are coming for Tesla like we've never seen before. 

I don't know who is still shitting out fantasy numbers and price points of $294 but you have to be kidding. Or who's saying this has the opportunity to be largest and greatest tech company in the world. This ain't it. 

Cathy Wood has stopped buying Tesla and Wedbush is about off this train too. You can make money off of this too. Don't miss this falling knife hit the floor. 

here's the price action and it's a sight to behold

2024-04-22 20:05:18,Tesla- Don't You Dare Buy Calls,"Despite this not being financial advise here are 24 reasons you should not go long on this stock in any way or form:

1. Ceo takes Ketamine
2. Ceo takes Ketamine (this is not a control c control v mistake)
3. Pay-package related dilution expected (\~10%) and is another dumpster fire of a debate; possible shareholder revolt coming
4. QoQ negative growth of sales has materialized (first negative quarter)
5. Decrease in operating margins (read point 6)
6. Price wars in an oligopolistic industry are akin to a knife fight that nobody wants to walk away from. Also they are just beginning instead of ending (Li Autos decreased price today in response)
7. Robo-taxis are technologically very far away (the boy who cried FSD) and is a solution looking for a problem
8. Model 2 is axed (probably not profitable enough the finance team is not stupid) so large TAM is chopped from valuation
9. Lay-offs talent attrition and underutilized factories incoming special hello to Gigafactory Berlin because EU EV sales are in negative growth
10. Ceo (this should be reason 1) has alienated it prime base i.e. democrats (look up recent WSJ article) which republican buyer growth hasn't materialized; they absolutely hate this guy in blue states
11. Ceo says the stock is in between waves of growth and also noted it was over-priced a few earnings ago
12. Ceo is not full-time and has many other pet projects like sending people to Mars
13. China is bank-rolling its EV makers (consipary theory) and their quality (BYD Li Autos) is no joke at all (not a consipracy theory)
14. Trip to India delayed because it is not a game changer
15. No single product that could yield out-sized growth is less than 2 years away from commcercialization
16. Aging model line; one of the oldest fleet in market without face lift
17. At the end of the day no car-marker will have 50% market share; humans like to think they are different and unique
18. Market is realizing it is not a tech company but a car company which are typically valued at 1/6 or 1/8th the price
19. Valuation was based on 50%+ growth which is a pipe-dream
20. Cash balance controlling for short-term liabilities is not great; if negative growth continues the existing slight-above junk credit rating will worsen
21. They once had a robot product demo in which a human being pretended to be a robot; funny they don't talk about that much anymore
22. Just laid-off the marketing team so no user conversion through education expected
23. Rivals have caught up with similar products and some like Ford/GM can rely on ICEs + Hybrids whose demand hasn't fallen as much; I would buy a BMW any day of the year over Tesla
24. Tesla forums on Reddit have a cult status where opposition can be banned. This show marks of irrationality which needs to be met with the timing of positive solvency

Here is 1 reason you might consider buying:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/burkina-faso-suspends-export-permits-small-scale-gold-production-2024-02-21/](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/burkina-faso-suspends-export-permits-small-scale-gold-production-2024-02-21/)

Burkina Faso is attempting to take back all the gold mining in their country so that they become the sole owners of the income from the massive gold deposits in the country. They've already began the process of kicking out Western countries such as France and now pushing to rid the country of US personnel. This comes in conjunction with a new partnership with Russia.

I believe that either will Burkina Faso take control of the mine or that pressure from Russia will force them to choose between a Canadian Company or theirs. The country is also in the midst of the massive war on terrorism leading the world in terrorist acts and deaths in 2024. All these compounding issues lead me to believe that the 90% ownership of the mine will be diminished  affecting the 300000+ Ounces of gold that IAMGOLD is earning from the mine.

My current position is 100 Puts - Strike $3.50 - Jan 2025 Exp. ",5,3
2024-04-22 16:52:17,Why does the market punish stocks making long term investments?,"I have noticed that lately the market has started to treat long term investments as an expense and sells off when it is announced.

Generally speaking stocks making long term investments has been a very good thing for investors.  Companies that underinvest historically are the one you want to avoid.

This type of thing only happens in  a depression or stagflation.  If it's. depression interest rates are going to 0% again.  If it's stagflation then it just buy and hold as much as you and hold it long term until it's over.",35,68

If you're a degenerate like me you probably at least some times trade 0DTE SPY options.

""Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it earns it; he who doesn't pays it"" - Albert Einstein

I always seem to make a good call in the 10-20% range then get greedy and get burned. So I made a little plot in python showing what daily gains would be at different gain levels with a 10% stop loss and 75% success rate.

If you're really good you can make a million in less than 60 trading days (\~3 months).

Be patient. Be regarded.

Edit: this assumes every trade is a YOLO.

Edit 2: this is a theoretical calculation guys it's just how many successful trades at 75% hit rate you need to make a mil from $100. Don't over think it.

2024-04-22 12:34:56,NYSE Considering 24/7 Trading? (Source: FT),"According to the Financial Times the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is polling market participants on the possibility of trading stocks around the clock as regulators examine an application for the first 24/7 bourse. The survey highlights growing interest in extended trading hours particularly among retail investors who are already able to trade cryptocurrencies and some stocks outside regular hours.

The idea of a 24/7 exchange has gained traction in recent years driven by the rise of retail investor activity and the availability of other markets such as US Treasuries and currencies for trading around the clock. However institutional interest has been muted due to concerns around liquidity and settlement risk. Some retail brokers already offer 24-hour weekday access to US stocks but an overnight exchange would require heavy regulatory oversight and approval.

A start-up 24 Exchange is seeking SEC approval to launch the first round-the-clock exchange with the survey coming ahead of a potential decision. The proposal has sparked debate with some arguing that extended trading hours would benefit investors while others raise concerns around staffing settlement and market stability. As the SEC scrutinizes the plans the outcome will determine whether the US stock market will follow the lead of other global markets and cryptocurrencies in offering 24/7 trading.

Since Zen 5 is coming to market in roughly three months and there's going to considerable performance uplifts of a 20% increase in instructions per clock and 30% multicore performance. AMD processors are already dominating the consumer market in terms of performance and they've been delivering a beatdown in the server space with their more cores per core per CPU. As for TSM their foundries are coming online early next next year for volume production for all their advanced process nodes.

The stock prices are going fluctuate or decrease in value until at least first or second quarter before the sentiment shifts and every vaguely intelligent technology investor will buy in. The (delay or hold back in terms of progress or development) of this subreddit might be able to make a double play with AMD and TSM given that the average sentiment will be that AMD do good and AMD use TSM fab therefore invest in TSM despite the fact the primary operational fabs are in Taiwan.

Tuesday:  GE is expected to kill it with a 159% increase in earnings. It‚Äôll be interesting with forward guidance considering the big trouble at Boeing.  RTX is expected to be flat with earnings but with the recent $95B military aid package passed I would think amazing guidance.  TSLA - big day with expected earnings to be down 41%.  Elon needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat!

Wednesday: Durable Goods Orders  0.3% expected with the last report of 0.5%.  BA earnings are expected to further diminish by an additional negative 12.5%. Wonder if they plan to name the new CEO?  Big Daddy Meta to report with estimated earnings almost doubling to $4.36.  High bar!

Thursday:  GDP estimated 2.4% versus 3.4% yoy.  CAT estimates are earnings up 4%. I would think the Infrastructure Bill to kick in by now.  Microsoft earnings expected to be up 13.7 % - low bar they need to double back flip over it.  Then GOOG expected earnings up 22%.  The band on TikToc will be interesting on the price action for Google & Meta this week.  Big AMZN expected earnings down 17% low bar - I like Amazon.

- There will be no rate cuts this year in fact there's a chance for a rate increase

2024-04-21 11:37:19,$MARA is about to explode,"Despite a massive bull run for bitcoin the bitcoin miners have lagged significantly.  The halving may be a reminder for spot holders that their asset won't be inflated away but it's also a warning for miners that their income stream is being cut in half every four years.  If you're new to bitcoin the bitcoin miners have two sources of revenue: transaction fees and block rewards.

Historically most of the revenue for bitcoin miners has come from the block rewards ie the new bitcoin being created by the protocol.  The block rewards were cut in half on 4/20 aka the halvening.  Fees don't make much money for miners:

&#x200B;

[bitcoin fees as a &#37; of total block rewards](https://preview.redd.it/b0ddnytabtvc1.png?width=1353&format=png&auto=webp&s=34652730f25848f864830e86404ed0115ff0fb95)

As you can see user fees as a percent of miner revenue has been close to zero for most of bitcoin's history.  Since the block subsidy is being cut in half every four years the future appears grim for the bitcoin miners.  Wall Street rates them holds or sells.  But what's that historically huge spike we just saw on 4/20?  That my fellow regards was caused by the *Runes* protocol which went live along with the halving.

Long story short Runes is an attempt to bring NFTs to Bitcoin.  Anyone paying attention to crypto at all the past couple years will know the potential mania that might come with this.  It hints that bitcoin could be a long-term threat to Ethereum something most analysts don't consider and it's causing a dramatic surge in demand for bitcoin block space right now.

Here's the realtime bitcoin fee data:

&#x200B;

[recent bitcoin transaction fees intraday](https://preview.redd.it/optlsmkvctvc1.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2fcd990ab19a029c3e45e9c23d84460bcafdd58)

You can see that fees per block have moved substantially higher post-halving compared with the previous week a period that was already showing elevated user fees compared with bitcoin's history.  The demand for bitcoin block space is increasing exponentially and this bodes well for bitcoin's future.

$MARA Marathon Digital is the market cap leader in bitcoin mining and has been very profitable as bitcoin has been going up.  EPS of $1.08 in the past year low debt to equity all with bitcoin at prices well below current levels.  Meanwhile US bitcoin ETFs have been the most successful launch in history.  ETFs were just approved in Hong Kong as well.  Bitcoin will be the world's first global money.  Now with Runes the narrative that the miners will struggle because nobody actually uses bitcoin will take a serious hit.  So you're going to see three things happening simultaneously in the next quarter:

&#x200B;

1. the bitcoin price is going to rip higher as high net worth individuals and small companies start allocating assets to bitcoin following a still-building wave of Wall Street marketing helped by...
2. ... the anti-bitcoin narrative that miners can't be profitable long-term and therefore the asset security model is broken takes a big hit since...
3. ... demand for block space will be rising significantly providing a much rosier outlook for the long-term future of bitcoin miners which will lead to ...
4. ... analyst upgrades as bitcoin miners will be reporting record earnings due to increased fees and rapidly rising bitcoin price

&#x200B;

With earnings going up AND P/E multiples widening the upside potential for $MARA is huge.  Now the cherry on top the grim outlook for miners has created a significant short interest of 18% of the float \~43 million shares short.

Between a new wave of insane bitcoiners FOMO'ing into NFTs at any price shorts covering and legitimately increasing revenue and prospects for the company imo this one is a firecracker set to pop.

Those stocks boomed on the hype yet now we are seeing big pullbacks. Now bears are saying it was just a bubble. Those types of stocks run until bears take over. Not saying they are bad but as markets fall they do too. You know what doesn't fall though obesity rates. The graph shows the increasing obesity rates.

Obesity rates aren't just gaining because people eat unhealthy but big companies encourage this to make money. We saw McDonald's and Krispy Kream partner up which will pretty much gaurenteed make them unreadable amounts of profit.

Now you may think to invest in those companies but I find way more upside in the cure. Big companies will keep promoting obesity and as the rates rise many will use ozempic. Increasing population and encouragement for obesity will keep rates rising while people use ozempic resulting in more and more use of it.

Anyways they have earnings coming up which I'm extremely bullish on. Not only that but they are in a wedge pattern right now going into earning. My plays are as follows: 5/3 130$ calls 5/3 135$ calls. Also have some stock. What do you guys think?",40,31

2024-04-20 17:17:26,Elon Musk‚Äôs succession at Tesla who might be next?,"Hello everyone
In the past months I have been collecting several articles around the subject in the title.

Elon Musk has always identified with Tesla and Tesla has always been identified with Musk. But  given the train wreck performance of the business (not discussing here the share price but just the real numbers and figures of the car business) it might be nice to discuss the topic here:

- Elon was the one deciding for 2.5 million production capacity and so far its factories are being utilised at 60-70% capacity with this number going down after the recent layoffs
- this huge production overcapacity forced the hand of the pricing strategy and after cutting prices globally for more than 15 months Q1-2024 was the first big quarter of negative growth. Q2-2024 will have negative growth too (bookmakers are much better than the market for Q2-2024 they are at 392k vs 480k from Wall Street; last Q2 Tesla sold 466k!)
- prices have been lowered again in the üá∫üá∏ confusing even the stronger supporters of Elon
- AI investments have been more words than facts and many executives from the Tesla chip department left in the recent months https://electrek.co/2023/12/07/tesla-head-dojo-supercomputer-out-over-issues-next-gen/
- China is the big profit center of Tesla and in the most recent layoffs they have been firing much more workers there. If China dies Tesla profits simply evaporates (here a link to a Chinese news https://www.eet-china.com/mp/a307257.html where it is said that GigaShanghai will cut production by 30% with the decision that is really affecting many suppliers in the area since Tesla is their largest customer; Aside from that Tesla China also cutting personnel in many dept by 30-40%. All Tesla stores seeing cuts)

Zhu in November 2022
The first one talking about Musk succession was the board member of Tesla James Murdoch in November 2022. When the stock was spiralling down and the name of Zhou came out please note he is the number Two at Tesla https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-china-boss-zhu-promoted-global-role-company-posting-2023-01-03/

Here a general article on who Zhu is https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/02/26/tesla-tom-zhu/

The CFO in May 2023
The name of the then CFO was made in May 2023 on a newspaper (WSJ) controlled by the family of James Murdoch https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-executive-elon-musk-cfo-zach-kirkhorn-b1998ae7

Both the times the stock recovered and nothing happened to Elon. But note that the CFO was fired/resigned in August 2023 replaced by the Chief of Accounting (that is a red flag)

Since then Elon was accused twice by the WSJ (newspaper of Murdoch) of being a drug addict 
- January 2024 https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1
- February 2024 https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-tesla-money-drugs-board-61af9ac4 in this second one it is said that some Tesla BoD felt forced in consuming drugs with him/did not like this addiction of his and resigned from the role for that reason

Of course Elon is a free man and he can do what he wants. But these two articles force us to ask several questions:
- why Elon/tesla did not sue the newspapers if the info were false?
- is then the drug addiction somehow related to the erratic pricing strategy and relentless sequence of extreme promises he has made so far ?
- what if some shareholders sue the BoD for lack of oversight asking to be refunded from their losses ? 
- does he really deserves a bonus if the BOD has never been independent ?

Several articles against Elon are questioning his leadership:
- Tesla chair under scrutiny for her oversight on Musk https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/teslas-board-elon-musk-robyn-denholm.html
- does Tesla have an Elon Musk problem? https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/hack/103671570

2024-04-20 15:26:27,UL Solutions,"Recently a 130 year old company made an IPO and I wanna hear the regards' opinions about them.

To put it simply UL Solutions (ULS) is doing testing for products safety and their performances and gives out certificates for safety regulatory compliances. This isn't a very competitive market and the relatively small number of companies and their age shows it. If I understand this company correctly it is essentially a bottleneck business whose services are a must for everyone who doesn't wanna f\*\*k around with OSHA.

In terms of revenue its not that interesting to say the least. No remarkable revenue increases no spectacular margins to speak of. They have increased their debt significantly from 0.63 debt to equity to 1.63( a standard procedure of any recent IPO I suppose but still worth mentioning)

The reason why this company caught my eye is that out of the 200m shares outstanding only 38m (less than fifth) is free float. It's probably a normal deal with new IPO's and regulations regarding insider ownership and what not. but with current 6.7B market cap and current float of just 38m the stock should be worth 175 dollars. It's worth 33 dollars at the moment.

Secondly and the more important detail 20 insiders bought 16m dollars worth of stock 13 of them bought more than 200k. It's been a while since I've seen such a huge insider purchase combined with a large number of insiders in a very short period of time.

So we have here an old established business with market dominance with a temporary discrepancy with the shares outstanding and free float and a massive insider buying.

If someone has a more interesting deep take on this company and its business/legacy/whatever I'll be glad to hear.",21,9

2024-04-20 12:52:54,NVDA - don't buy the dip (yet),"The past few weeks I've been eyeing NVDA's run back to its pre-earnings highs ahead of their upcoming report. As I mentioned before NVDA will be making a round-trip to its pre-earning print before it bounces again. I also firmly believe they will crush earnings expectations and the stock will bounce though likely not hit new all-time highs just yet.

So the big question is - what's the optimal trading strategy here? Here are my thoughts:

* Ignore any short-term rallies this week if they happen. NVDA likely has more room to run still. It will remain somewhat depressed as emotions rather than fundamentals trade.
* Ignore the hype.  But - believe the hype.  What NVDA has is a lock on a market that's seeing tremendous investments.  This isn't stopping any time soon.  The stock will go higher (just not yet).

If possible I'd recommend staying on the sidelines for another 2-3 weeks. It'll be tempting to jump in on temporary rallies if you're unestablished and painful to watch dips if you're already holding. But I expect volatility to persist a bit longer.

Puts are off the table for me personally (I avoid those). I'm looking to accumulate shares in the $600-700 range ahead of earnings. Even if it doesn't hit those prices I will start picking up especially if market looks past its current weakness after this week's PCE print.

Gains started off with a single SMCI call option in the end of January when they had their first ~$100 jump which made $12k in profit.

Bought some some more after which went up about $25k but didn't sell so it dropped before NVDA earnings and went back up after. Still didn't sell dropped again.

During all this bought NVDA AVGO AMD and COST options. Struck gold first week of March. Sold quite a bit and made about $50k. Should've been happy and put the money aside but being the regard I am starting putting some back in slowly and proceeded to lost almost all of those gains.

Ended with this week where I tried SPC 0DTEs because the first day I made like $10k. Beginners luck but too dumb to get that though my thick skull.

So here I am almost no gains after two months of trading (*cough* gambling). Lucky that my hard stop was my own money.

I can't believe this all started with me wanting to make like $30k slowly over the year to offset mortgage payments and essentially have some discretionary spending money. Made a lot more a lot faster. Regarded at heart so lost all of it.

I don't think I should be doing this anymore but my heart is hurting either way. Woke up with this pounding in my check and hope sharing it here relieves some of that pain. üò•

Now I‚Äôm not saying we‚Äôre going to bounce back up and hold over but we will most definitely see a bounce on Monday at least unless some more stupid shit happens over the weekend. What happens during the big earnings and PCE data will decide where we go from now on until NVDA and SMCI earnings.

I'm always way early so I might be bag holding NVDA for a year or two but I added at 787 today.  Rate cuts no rate cuts war no war it isn't gonna change that the dollar is being debased and productive companies will still get theirs.  Long term bull on NVDA... short term probably down since I just bought though (sorry).

2024-04-20 01:44:41,Casanova wants you to hang in there.,"I am Casanova. Notice I don‚Äôt have a percentage because I actually have gained more than lost and withdrawn more than deposited? Next week the Asssociated Press is meeting me to document and shoot how I decided my investments on shorting $DJT. Most of you are new here but I‚Äôve been shitposting on this board since before RoaringKitty and his DD squeezed. To give context: Dino. Wooderson. Suepaphly. Swish. The list goes on but I digress.

I see that many of you are at a crisis point where it seems like the markets moved to literally fuck your puts and fuck your calls. J Pow got you by the balls? Yes. The moment the FED said we may have to retain interest rates we went from ATH to three months ago. Yet everyone is shocked at the news statements and it‚Äôs why I started learning strangles on the stocks with the most potential for volatility like the bankrupt $DJT exit liquidity stock.

That being said I feel your pain and the last thing I want is another one of us dead. So no puts on $ROPE. My entire chart is a timeline of my ex marriage. The highs and lows I hit. The really bad lows but I always kept investing. No matter how bad it got I kept trying. I learned why my trades failed. I failed at many more. 

Yet I can say yes this was a net positive for me no matter how pathetic it seems. At the depths of my graph I could make an accountant cry.

You are here because you want your money to work for your time. Not vice versa. But as long as you don‚Äôt give up you will be able to always earn money back to trade and make up time.

I love you all.

2024-04-19 21:27:39,Today has been a crash for NVDA but there's no need to panic.,"Market cap erased by 10% in a single day. I decided to escape from the top after NVDA plunged below 823 a key support level. Therefore I cleared all my holdings of NVDA and NVDL at a price of around 810-820. Aside from that I profited 30% from intraday shorting by buying and selling 790 put which compensated for about 60% of my loss incurred during the escpae.

680-740 is an ultrastrong support level for NVDA. The 1-yr forward PE of NVDA has fallen to 31 a comfortable level. If the price can further plunge by 5%-10% the forward PE value will be a typical level for mega-caps in the tech sector which is small for NVDA (we need to consider its growth potential).

The earnings call may be a tipping point for NVDA but it is still 1 month away. I expect that NVDA to be consolidating between 680 and 740 before that the gap never filled after its blockbusting 2023 annual earnings.

Here is my plan:

1. 40% for left entry. Have bought 10% of 9/20 1000 call when the price fell to 760. Expect to buy another 10% when the price falls to 720-740 and another 20% when the price falls to 680-700.
2. 40% for right entry. If the price starts to go up before the earnings buy 20% at the tipping point and another 20% when the 9-day EMA crosses the 26-day EMA from the below a key indicator of buying.
3. If the price of NVDA drops below 680 clear all long positions and use 50% for short-selling namely put option @ 700. This will continue at all rebounds until NVDA falls to 500 the price last December.

Update: Change of Plan.

After rethinking what happened to NFLX I have decided to clear all long positions and wait until the market stabilizes itself or a new trend emerges. There exists a strong probability that 'selling at the news' will occur. Even if META MSFT GOOGL all report blockbusting earnings beating expectations in both guidelines and quarterly results the stock prices may still dip let alone something goes wrong with their earnings like what happened to GOOGL earlier this year. AMZN dipped 3% while META plunged 4% all because of NVDA today. Similar things will happen if one of the mega caps delivers worse-than-expectation earnings.

The new plan:

1. Close all long positions on Monday to avoid risks. If there is a rebound on Monday and Tuesday buy a very small short position (\~2%) by putting NVDA.
2. If something happens during the earnings put NVDA and buy SQQQ. If the earnings are all good wait until all indices stabilize before buying long positions again.",33,46

Not looking to go full regard but I put my severance payment into SOFI ahead of earnings. And hey I‚Äôm not going to use ChatGPT to convince you to join the üöÄüöÄüöÄüß®

Oops how did that dynamite get in there‚Ä¶? Well for every potential rocket there‚Äôs the chance it explodes in your face.

I‚Äôve worked in Big Tech and FinTech and think SoFi has a good shot at differentiating their offerings in the FinTech sector and recognizing a higher valuation as they grow their technology offerings. 

Specifically watching Galileo and Technisys. When you talk platforms and banking cores it‚Äôs easy to lose people but this is where the wonder of finance happens. This is how banks and firms offering financial products can better compete. Think upgrading your Windows 95 desktop to a new computer. Maybe that old thing can still run and you don‚Äôt know how to get your old programs to run on the new one‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôre going to have to switch.

Outside of that the continued cross selling of services will be important and lowered customer acquisition costs which I think is doable.

Whether the street is ready to recognize SoFi‚Äôs recent profitability and whether institutions continue to take significant share‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs an argument to be had. I think we‚Äôre getting there and don‚Äôt buy the whole well the stock has been on a downtrend for years why now? Well because it‚Äôs profitable now and differentiated from being purely a student loans company now.

2024-04-19 20:35:56,This is the top before the crash,"Imagine you‚Äôre a hedge fund and your main motivation is profit (an unfamiliar concept in this sub) and you know that Powell is full of shit but the market hasn‚Äôt priced that in yet - it is quite literally a classic game of prisoner‚Äôs dilemma. 

You cash out too soon and you miss out on those sweet-sweet tendies. You cash out too late and you‚Äôre filling out an application at Wendy‚Äôs. 

What we saw today was a major shift in sentiment among market makers. What should‚Äôve been a rebound off of the good news that neither Iran or Israel actually tried to inflict damage on one another resulted in a steady crash across the market with more markets makers net short than long for the first time in months. 

It‚Äôs only retail investors left who are net long than short and the MM‚Äôs are going to capitalize on this to profit off of us.

Given that earnings season is coming up (currently there is a black out period for orgs where they cannot participate in stock buy backs) there will be a boost driven by companies buying stock in the coming weeks before a sharp decline driven by market makers selling off to retail investors (as they have historically done during high interest rate environments).

Furthermore we see the elevated VIX indicating high volatility which has resulted in market makers reducing every rally we see and the stocks continuing to drop.

With no interest rates coming this year MM‚Äôs will continue to sell and short as most companies will fail to grow in a high interest rate environment due to cutbacks.

Only then will be see layoffs that will finally trigger the fed to cut rates. It presently won‚Äôt happen given that there just isn‚Äôt enough capital leaving circulation and congress quite frankly does not want to do anything about it in the way of taxing it out of the bloated economy.

Hedge funds will act rationally and continue to net sell this year reducing shareholder value until they see a reason not to. It‚Äôs up to us to either sell hedge or get slaughtered in the process. The choice is yours.

2024-04-19 20:30:31,Is the growth in trading algorithms responsible for manic-depressive markets?,"Today‚Äôs markets seem to cycle between euphoria and depression. 

During the euphoria phase it‚Äôs not uncommon to see the major indices up 6 7 8 trading days in a row while individual stocks are up 10 11 12 13 days in a row. 

During the depression phase it‚Äôs the complete opposite: the S&P 500 has sold off for 6 straight days while many individual stocks e.g. Dave & Buster‚Äôs (PLAY) is down 12 days in a row and Overstock/Beyond (BYON) has only had 1 green day w/minuscule gain in April thus far following a 13-day losing streak.

It‚Äôs not just a matter of very high & very low RSI readings but once the algos identify a trend they seem to blindly follow it and squeeze out every last penny until they can‚Äôt anymore.

I was looking at historical trade data over the rise & fall of the first internet bubble ie \~1995‚Äì2002 and to my surprise this type of behavior was not at all common back then. The aggregate gain (\~1000%) and loss (\~90%) were massive but every few days the trend would reverse. 

For example Internet bubble poster-child Cisco (CSCO) gained +3% 4% 1% 2% and 3% in the 5 trading days between June 15-21 1999 then fell 3% and 2%. 

Swing traders could easily make money both on the way up and on the way down as price actions moved more like zigzags than straight lines. This is no longer the case in modern-day algo-driven markets.",1,12

2024-04-19 20:19:50,What are your thoughts on Intel? Price dropped a lot this week do you think it will go up long term? How does it compare to Nvidia?,"Alright degens buckle up 'cause Uncle Pat (that's Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger) is trying to make $INTC un-suck. Let's talk turnaround potential and moon tickets... or maybe flaming dumpster fire. Here's the lowdown:

1. Forget the foundries we makin' our own chips! üè≠

Intel's like ""screw it"" to TSMC and is going all-in on their own fabs. IDM 2.0 baby! New plant in Ireland billions pumped into this gamble. Could work could go BOOM.

1. Intel 18A - the secret sauce? üöÄ...or üí©?

This new chip process it's got fancy names ‚Äì RibbonFETs and PowerVia or whatever. Supposed to be smaller faster slurp less juice. BUT history says new chip tech = delays and headaches. Projections sound yummy reality often tastes like garbage.

1. Gaudi 3 ‚Äì Nvidia killer or just another dead fish? üêü

Intel's swinging at AI with this new chip. They say it'll beat the crap outta Nvidia's H100 on the 18A process. Listen I like an underdog but Nvidia's a damn BEAST with a huge lead. Intel playin' catch-up with broken shoes here.

1. Uncle Sam throws Intel a bone ü¶¥

CHIPS Act = money printer goes brrr for Intel. Makes building fabs cheaper. Nice for them but they gotta DELIVER not keep fumbling the ball like usual.

1. AI dreams... but they gotta BUILD IT first ü§ñ

Intel talkin' big about oneAPI their software magic that makes AI chips work nice. Sounds good but devs gotta love it and that takes time. Intel ain't exactly known for sleek software.

Bottom line: $INTC could be a moonshot IF everything goes right. That's a BIG if. More likely it's a rollercoaster ‚Äì insane highs if they pull even half their crap off devastating lows if Pat screws it up again.

TLDR: High risk high potential reward. Buy $INTC if you like your tendies spicy and enjoy watching dumpster fires. HOLD if you're an actual regard. NFA I eat crayons for breakfast. üñçÔ∏è üíé üôå",5,19

Companies use it mostly to offer a bad Customer Support experience to their users like they did with those awful chatbots a few years ago.

So Nvidia sold a lot of chips OpenAI and Microsoft sold a lot of subscriptions and that's pretty much it.   
  
There aren't many other companies actually making money from AI since there aren't real use cases where it's actually useful in a B2B case. 

OpenAI did a great job of promoting Gen AI as being the magical solution we've all seen the article claiming that AI paid a human on Taskrabbit to solve a reCAPTCHA but that never actually happened.

2024-04-19 15:33:34,Will these puts print?,"Hello fellow regards

I never thought this day would come. I have turned from a üêÇ to a üåàüêª. After getting pounded by my calls all week and the Israeli attack on Iran I decided to pull out of all my calls today at open. I was left with 4k and my smooth brain wondered what could be done to make some money in this bear market? So I decided to buy some further dated puts on spy and qqq along with tqqq spxl puts and sqqq spxs calls.

My strike prices are ATM or ITM in some cases because I have realised its much better to buy a few good calls rather than a lot of regarded ones. What do you guys think of these calls? Do they have a chance to print and make up for some of my losses? How further down do you guys see the market go down?",10,12
2024-04-19 14:59:48,$IMKTA Diamond in the Rough?,"Have a small position in $IMKTA sold a bunch when it hit over $100 now back around $74/75. The book value for the company is $78.73 so it's trading below that. Warren Buffett used to do this trick back in the heyday. 

May be a diamond in the rough. Figured I'd share to help people out with an unconventional idea.

Looking at the intrinsic value of the company I did a 0% growth rate which gave a value of $72.78 (Slightly below the current price of $74.15) when I bumped it up to a 1% growth rate it gave $89.91 which is at a discount of about 21%.

They have averaged a growth rate of 18% in their EPS over the last 5 years. So I put into the calculator a growth rate of 5% which provided an intrinsic value of 158.40 which would be a return of 213%. And they pay a dividend. 

&#x200B;

The company has been around since 1963 and the CEO started at the company at 16 years old as a service clerk (posted a picture).  And just 4 days ago the company announced a stock buyback of 2 million shares.

Just an idea not a recommendation but I bought about 1800 shares for my portfolio. at an average price of $75.29 currently at a small loss.

2024-04-19 14:49:27,Is the Fed's Restrictive Monetary Policy Really Doing Enough to Cool Inflation?,"It seems like the Fed's aggressive rate hikes over the past year haven't been as effective at cooling demand and taming inflation as many hoped. Despite the most rapid tightening cycle in decades the economy and labor market remain remarkably resilient. This has led to a growing debate among Fed officials and economists about whether current monetary policy is actually restrictive enough.

Many policymakers like Chair Powell have signaled they expect rates to remain at their peak for some time. But there's increasing concern that high borrowing costs aren't sufficiently reining in demand to get inflation back to the 2% target. Some like Boston Fed President Susan Collins have warned that without cooling demand further prices will continue facing upward pressure.

Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that much of the inflation progress in 2023 was due to easing supply chain issues and strong immigration while demand chugged along unfazed. The economy grew rapidly in the second half of the year and retail sales continue exceeding expectations. This has skeptics questioning just how much policy is really constraining things.

Financial conditions have also played a confounding role. The market rally and drop in Treasury yields late last year spurred by Fed hints at eventual rate cuts may have worked against the central bank's tightening efforts. Some worry this easing of financial conditions could cause inflation's decline to stall out above target.

The situation has a growing number of Fed officials like Governor Michelle Bowman warning that policy may need to get more restrictive and stay there longer than anticipated. Cuts are looking both slimmer and further out on the horizon. Some are even coming around to the idea that the post-pandemic economy may simply run with permanently higher rates than we've been used to.

At this point it seems the Fed has little choice but to wait and see if their medicine is working. But don't be surprised if rates stay higher for longer or even climb further if inflation remains stubbornly elevated in the face of resilient demand. Buckle up because this inflation fight looks far from over!
Thoughts? Do you think the Fed is being restrictive enough or will they need to get even tougher to win the war on inflation?",10,19

2024-04-19 12:45:58,"The historic normal return of the stock market is 8%.
The market has done about 12-15% per year for the past 10 on average.","The fact that so many people are posting asking why the market is down 5% from the highs it hit this year
prompted me to take a minute to explain. 

This is what you call ""mean reversion"".
If you flip a coin 100 times and it falls heads 100% of the time it's still a 50-50 chance on the next flip to be either-or.

But if you flip that coin an infinite amount of times it will be closer and closer to 50/50 with sometimes landing on the side.

If your expected average on the stock market is 8% it doesn't mean that it will be a flat 8% return. Some years it'll be up and some it'll be down.

It can even have decades above or below that.

In the short-term sentiment matters a lot but in the long-run fundamentals are all that really matters.

If earnings grow at a pace that justifies the increase in prices the market will hold but at some point they won't.

TLDR: Don't panic this is normal. There's always a way to make money just figure out where the flows are going.

2024-04-19 04:05:57,No WW3 yet,"This strike wasn't a big deal. Israel was demonstrating force capability in regions with critical targets they avoided nuclear/civilian targets which would have been extremely escalatory. Middle east conflict could still escalate but if anything this strike made it *less* likely that it would happen tomorrow. If the casualty count is low/zero its further proof Israel was demonstrating capability not truly attacking. My guess is that this is why futures aren't tanking further.

Looks like [3 drones were shot down over Isfahan](https://aje.io/akzdf6?update=2846016) an important nuclear research/weapons development city. Israel might have been showing Iran that they could hit them if they want to. This after Iran showed the opposite that even \~600 munitions can't meaningfully get to Israel. So this whole thing might have been Israel shooting at nothing 2 miles from a strategically significant target to prove to Iran they could get to a bunch of important military targets if they needed to. That could put to rest the current pressure for retaliation in Israel without forcing Iran to do the same. Especially if the casualty count is zero; there's no need for Iran to respond.

Still medium and long term this isn't great for middle east geopolitical stability but if it was WW3 time the news would be different. My 2 cents

2024-04-19 01:00:34,Are We Approaching the Breaking Point for Stock Valuations and Interest Rates?,"Stocks have been on a tear since last October with valuations (price-to-earnings ratios) soaring from around 20x to 25x (the blue line in the chart). This surge in stock valuations coincided with a sharp drop in interest rates with the 10-year Treasury yield plunging from 5% to below 4% in just a few months (the white line using the inverted scale on the right).

It makes sense that lower rates would boost valuations as they increase the present value of future earnings. However here's where things get interesting: even as rates started climbing again earlier this year valuations continued to creep higher instead of reversing course as you might expect.

So what gives? Well the economy has shown surprising resilience despite the higher rate environment. This has allowed investors to focus on positive factors like the strength of the US consumer and the potential for AI-driven earnings growth essentially shrugging off the headwinds from elevated interest rates.

But this disconnect between rates and valuations might not last forever. Morgan Stanley warns that there's a breaking point around the 4.35% level on the 10-year Treasury yield where higher rates could really start to weigh on valuations and stock prices. Lo and behold we just crossed that threshold.
If rates continue to march higher investors may start to factor this into their valuation models bringing those lofty multiples back down to earth. 

This could spell trouble not just for riskier rate-sensitive segments of the market like small-caps and value stocks (which tend to have higher financing costs and more leveraged balance sheets) but also for the market leaders if they fail to deliver on ambitious earnings expectations.

As we head into the thick of earnings season it's crucial to monitor not just the headline results and management commentary but also the trajectory of interest rates in the background. The stock market has been able to defy gravity in the face of rising rates so far - but that might not be the case for much longer. Don't be caught off guard if this crucial macro variable reasserts its influence with a vengeance.",14,9

(Reuters) - Jabil Inc has placed Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Wilson on a paid leave since April 15 pending completion of an investigation related to corporate policies the electronic components maker said on Thursday.

The company appointed its current CFO Michael Dastoor as the interim CEO effective April 19 according to its regulatory filing.

Jabil pointed to the filing in response to a request seeking more details on why Wilson was placed on leave.

Wilson was named CEO in November 2022 succeeding Mark Mondello and assumed the role on May 1 2023.

The company had last year announced that it would reduce headcount as part of its restructuring plan estimating to recognize about $300 million in pre-tax restructuring and other related costs through fiscal year 2024.

I believe Paramount Global is trading at a discount when you factor EPS improvements from the last two quarters and trading at a 13x/14x PE on that basis. 

If we take away any deal aspect Paramount is undervalued when compared to competitors. I would consider most competitors to be trading at a PE of 18x while the industry average for the entertainment sector is 35x. Given market conditions I would tie it to the PE of 18x which would be approximately an $13 near term price target and overall if forward guidance stays in line a price target of $30 to $40 conservatively by 2025.

I think the reason for the discounted share price is shrouded by current deal talks with Skydance which would require some level of dilution for Paramount to acquire Skydance at a pretty ridiculous valuation of $4B to $5B. I‚Äôm fairly confident the Skydance deal won‚Äôt be reached if everything that has been reported as rumors is the entirety of the deal. I would paraphrase the DD talks between Paramount and Skydance going like this

Paramount Special Committee: Why do you think Skydance is valued at $4B to $5B?

Skydance and Ellison: Because we said so.. 

Overall bullish on Paramount. I think it‚Äôs trading in undervalued territory. Q1 earnings is coming early on April 29th by comparison to past reporting dates. Do with this what you will! 

Edit 1: To elaborate on the potential deal aspects David Ellison is essentially trying to make a deal to acquire NAI and the PARA A shares from Shari Redstone. He is also wanting to merge Skydance and Paramount which most rumors reported it being dilutive to common shareholders and beneficial for Shari and/or all voting shareholders. He‚Äôs also trying to value Skydance at $4B to $5B based on funding raised but in my opinion if Skydance was listed publicly with current revenues would get absolutely shit on at that valuation based on their revenue (not evening earnings). 

Apollo has submitted a $26B all cash deal for equity and debt and Byron Allen has discussed potentially a $30B all cash deal. Between the two the average share price range for commons would be about $17 to $22 per share. 

Subscriptions for Paramount+ were growing steadily last year and Paramount per their last earnings forecasted profitability for their streaming segment by 2025. Overall I think that Paramount could start selling off some of its linear elements and reduce debt as well throughout the year and improve valuation metrics pretty readily in that sense. It‚Äôs a dramatic story if you have been paying attention. ",23,21

2024-04-18 18:32:01,$37250 of BITX  @ avg of $46.91 in ROTH. Almost All In YOLO,"I DCAd too quick on my rebalances. But I am 99% in. 794 shares of BITX with a strategy to hold until December with the possibility of slowly rebalancing into other positions. 

This is an ETF with a BTC 2x long strategy. I'm in for the long haul. ROTH is maxed for the years so it is what it is. I have perhaps $325 in other BTC ETFs that are Spot that I may move over into BITX if it dips below $35.

I've increased my position over the last month. If I were patient Id have had closer to an average cost of $42. But you live and you learn. 

Price correlation history:
Oct 18 BITX closed at $12 and BTC closed at $28.3k
Nov 17 BITX closed at $18.62 and BTC closed at $36.5k
Dec 18 BITX closed at $23 and BTC closed at $42.6k
Jan 18 BITX closed at $20.6 and BTC closed at $41.25k
Feb 16 BITX closed at $32.3 and BTC closed at $52.1k
Mar 13 BITX peaked at $59.6 and BTC peaked at $73.1k
Mar 25 BITX closed at $54 and BTC closed at $69.8k
Apr 2 BITX closed at $45.7 and BTC closed at $65.4k
Apr 17 BITX dipped and closed at $38 and BTC closed around $61.2k

Info:
So as a leveraged Future instrument it does dip more when BTC dips however their cash reserves and multi month spread allows them to buy the dips on futures contracts. Currently BITX is in three months worth and has a billion dollars cash on hand. 

tl;dr:
6 months buy and hold to the peak would see a $2.58 return on the dollar for BTC or a $5.17 return for BITX. 

Rationale (blinded by the light of BTC I know):

I fully expect BTC to go to $100k before Q3 and I expect it to hit $120-140k by the end of the year. By extension I expect BITX to hit somewhere in the ball park of $100 per share when BTC hits $100k.

And when BTC hits 120-140k I expect BITX to be in the ballpark of $160-$200(or a split of some kind).

Exit Strategy:

If the BTC Bull run resumes I will rebalance my 99% BITX/1% BTC ETF portfolio daily to maintain ratios. 

I further plan to adjust the ratios perhaps weekly. My plan is for every consecutive green Candle Day I will move 1% from BITX to IBIT. For every consecutive red candle day I will move 1% from IBIT back to BITX and rebalance. 

I won't plan to adjust the ratios until there are consecutive green days above my break even point. 

To my fellow traders we are all in one another dearest regards. 
Sincerely

2024-04-18 18:07:16,Is the Oil Market Overreacting? A Look at Brent Call Option Trends,"Bloomberg [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-16/trading-in-bullish-oil-options-hits-record-after-iran-s-attack) that trading volumes for Brent oil call options have hit another record high. Typically such a surge is interpreted as traders fearing further escalation in the Middle East assuming that record trading volumes indicate significant concern.

However I believe it's not so straightforward. Some are more fearful (the buyers) while others are less so (the sellers).

A closer look at the chart reveals that trading volumes for Brent options have been rapidly increasing in general leading to higher spikes.

The chart doesn't suggest anything about an inevitable Armageddon. Moreover the oil market has started to stabilize.

No doubt the dating app business is tough because many of the users leave the app once they find success.  Plus many users don‚Äôt pay for the premium subscriptions.  However this company is about to turn the corner to profitability and has been far too beat up.  The avg analyst estimate for next year‚Äôs earnings is $.93.  Add a 21X multiple which is honestly low for a company growing its annual revenue 16%.  You get $19.53.  Discount it back by one year at 7% and its $18.25.   Add a 30% margin of safety and you get $12.77.   I‚Äôm a buyer at any price below $12.77.    I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this company became an acquisition target.  Amongst my friends everyone mentions Bumble and Hinge as the best dating apps.  At a $1.8B market cap I could see a company like Google or Meta wanting to acquire Bumble.  They could easily promote the app and cut down on the company‚Äôs main expense (advertising).

This stock is now trading below it‚Äôs cash value of $9.58 per share.  The company actually has more cash on their balance sheet than they have market cap.

Although Tesla once had the same problem.  At a $8.6B market cap this company is worth a flyer.  Don‚Äôt make it more than 1% of your portfolio but I think it‚Äôs worth a flyer at these depressed prices.  Amazon already has a 16.6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order so don‚Äôt be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8.6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely don‚Äôt short this stock).  

TSLA

Honestly I‚Äôm ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that I‚Äôve had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who‚Äôs smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friend‚Äôs Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years you‚Äôll have Tesla robotaxis.  You‚Äôll open your Tesla app order a ride and it‚Äôll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. That‚Äôs a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%) that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that‚Äôs 1.34T market cap or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety and I‚Äôm buying this stock any price below $294.






MCD SBUX
Honestly both these companies are probably close to fairly priced trading around 21X next year‚Äôs earnings.  But in a market where most stocks are overpriced these two stand out.  And I‚Äôm willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years.  Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing they will at least increase with monetary inflation.  But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally.  I live in Peru and both McDonald‚Äôs and Starbux are extremely popular with the locals.  Especially McDonald‚Äôs.",0,43

2024-04-18 13:41:36,Bitcoin Halving and the Brewing Storm in Crypto Mining: A Deep Dive,"As most of you know the Bitcoin halving is due in just a few days. This event which occurs roughly every four years is a built-in feature of Bitcoin that reduces the reward for mining new blocks in half. Currently miners are rewarded 900 BTC per day but post-halving this will drop to 450 BTC. With Bitcoin's current valuation this reward reduction could slash the industry's annual revenue by an estimated $10 billion. That's huge!

Previous halvings have historically led to significant price rallies for Bitcoin which helped mitigate the reduced mining rewards. However this time the context is different and here‚Äôs why:

1. Increased Operational Costs: The mining difficulty has shot up nearly six times since the last halving driven by a surge in the miner population chasing the same reward pie. Consequently to stay competitive miners are forced to invest in more expensive equipment which is a hefty financial commitment.

2. Energy Cost Competition: Miners are also vying against deep-pocketed Big Tech firms for affordable electricity. These firms are investing heavily in AI and data centers and utility companies prefer them over crypto miners for their stable financial outlook leaving miners with higher electricity costs.

Now here's the kicker. The increased skepticism around the profitability of crypto mining has led traders to place significant short bets against crypto mining stocks. Last I checked the total short interest for a group of 15 crypto-mining stocks is hovering around $2 billion representing almost 15% of these companies' available shares. To put that into perspective it's three times the US market average short interest.

The market seems to be signaling a lack of confidence in the mining industry's ability to cope with the halving and rising operational costs. We're looking at a potential violent move up or a downturn in mining stocks depending on how the situation unfolds.

2024-04-18 08:03:21,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703)  and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019 Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)) and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour a quality engineer at the company said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told frankly to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy L. Krupski used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him and before leaving the company L. discovered that from his work computer he could have access to all the data of the company including financials product defections and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions autopilot/fsd problems phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed at the launch the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks.

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions mostly about the MX & MS lineups but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension steering or wheel assembly company records show. Those accident claims which have not been previously reported by the media were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016 but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021 but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack) Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales and moving into other expenses it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers they said though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again in order to increase profitability scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904) some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet after the first articles nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset that's why Tesla never sued them but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

He says that its 'because he saw the financials' while working on a accounting software deliverable for SAP with Netflix as its customer. But when I pressed for more specifics he refused to elaborate. 

Betting against Netflix stock before earnings is no longer safe. My dad buys terrible companies regularly and gets it wrong about the Mag 7. If you are betting against Netflix stock your funds are not SAFU. 

On another note Evercore ISI has also released a pessimistic outlook on Netflix being unable to exceed investor expectations for core subscriber count. This investor bank rated one star on Google Reviews has regularly delivered inaccurate stock recommendations to me. The only stock that it has accurately upgraded and downgraded consistently is William-Sonoma.

[See that 56000 million yen? \(1 American = 154 Yen\) Thats what they predicted they would make in operating income for the year. I believe they will come in much higher than that. ](https://preview.redd.it/scscjw57l5vc1.png?width=1305&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4d77142cd38fca3487dd75feccc0b6d6e719836)

Why do I believe that? Well here is where they were at the end of Q3 (Q3 in Japan ends in December)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vj3xes4yl5vc1.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=049dd3ace3b2e16cc74be9214dd0384c3fd2cc55

A measly 8300 million yen needed to meet their Q4 goal and most importantly they released major new IP in their Q4 fiscal year. 

Enter Dragon's Dogma 2. Now I won't subject you to all my terrible algebra but with an estimated 2.5 million units sold and a price point of $70 per title as well as some complicated assumptions for margin... I estimate they roughly hit about 12000 million yen in operating income from this new IP alone with probably about another 8000 million in their 'catalog' title sales. A healthy amount of that 8000 million yen estimate is coming from a huge resurgence of popularity in their Monster Hunter World title in Q1. 

That puts us at about 20 million yen operating income for their Q4. 

In the trailing twelve months that means it will be replacing this pretty number here. 

[All Yen in thousands](https://preview.redd.it/0my5xay3n5vc1.png?width=1509&format=png&auto=webp&s=b29faed9362bf43290e5b6c5f276476a77036b55)

This should give us a new TTM of about 68000 million yen. Significantly better than the 56000 million yen forecast! 

Now what effect will this have on the price? Well with their significant margin growth and high value IP including a new mainline monster hunter title coming in their Q4 2024 forecast. I believe this company to be worth a P/E of at least 25-30 when comparing to similar industry peers. 

That puts us at a 15 - 35 % jump over the current share price in what I consider a play with minor downside and probably a very strong positive upside if you are looking out to Q4 2024 (Remember in Japan that is end of March 2025.)

Also if you decide to enter into this trade beware of CCOEY having less than desirable volatility make sure to use limit orders. ",10,8

2024-04-18 03:05:13,DD on Zoetis (ZTS): risk reward looking attractive here??,"This is my first DD so please be gentleüòä

The recent plunge of ZTS was due to a WSJ article published on 04/12:

[https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/dog-cat-arthritis-drugs-bcdddea6](https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/dog-cat-arthritis-drugs-bcdddea6)

Quote: ""The FDA received more than 3800 reports of side effects concerning the drugs through the end of last year. The European Medicines Agency has received more than 12300 reports of side effects involving Librela and more than 7700 for Solensia since 2021 when the drugs went on sale in Europe. The figures include reports from the U.S. and other countries outside of the European Union.""

But a 04/15 Morgan Stanley survey of 75 US vets found: ""Almost all respondents (98%) already prescribe or plan to prescribe ZTS' Librela (canine pain) and Solensia (feline pain) with over half naming Librela (63%) and/or Solensia (36%) as the most impactful new products. On recent concerns over Librela side effects¬†*only 4% of practitioners are concerned enough to be deterred from prescribing Librela 83% have some level of concern but still prescribe and 13% are not at all concerned.*¬†""

Vet surveys done by JPM and BofA had very similar findings.

Critically Librela & Solensia are prescription drugs so the vets opinions matter the most.

Also per Morgan Stanley:

* ""we estimate WW mAbs sales (Librela and Solensia) contribute $0.73 to our FY24 EPS (13% of total) and $1.01 to our FY25 EPS (16%)"" -- on the day of the WSJ story the stock plunged 7.8% pricing in roughly 50% reduction of the mAbs sales already?? This overreaction is clearly not supported by the vet surveys.
* ""the implied valuation without all pain mAbs globally (a harsh assumption but for analysis purposes) would be 27.6x FY25 at the current share price still below its 10-year historical average of 29.2x suggesting the stock may be overly punished.""

Lastly let's look at the technical side. ZTS is currently at critical support levels on the weekly chart. If it continues to hold these levels I think the risk reward from here will look very attractive!

Yes Elon has been an absolute clown show of a CEO and as a former Elon simp I can‚Äôt defend him anymore. He spends more time shit posting on Twitter than actually running Tesla.

Now that being said is it time to inverse Reddit?

Tesla‚Äôs energy division has quietly quadrupled its profits (https://cleantechnica.com/2024/01/24/tesla-energy-storage-solar-profits-nearly-quadrupled-in-2024/amp/). 

In terms of self-driving data Tesla boasts 3 billion+ miles of data. I can tell you that no other company comes close to having that much data. Tesla is literally sitting on a gold mine and none of you regards seem to understand just how valuable it is.

In my humble opinion Robotaxis are likely nowhere near completion and the regulatory red tape is probably immense. I don‚Äôt foresee Tesla rolling robotaxis out anytime soon and hence k expect a capitulation in their stock price near term. But 10+ years from now Tesla is going to be ahead of the curve.

Additionally projections are that 80% of new vehicles sold in 2030 will be electric. And if you think shitty Chinese cars will flood the American market you‚Äôre dead wrong. The US would never let that happen. Also Tesla has a monopoly on the charging network. As an EV owner let me tell you that the current infrastructure outside Tesla‚Äôs network is hot doggie.

I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve seen Reddit and the media shit on Elon and he proves them wrong time and time again. Yes he‚Äôs been a complete moron as of late but the guy is still a visionary.",194,247

Personally I was kind of excited for it to drop so I can further average down.

2024-04-18 00:10:47,Why RDDT is going to surprise on earnings in 4 charts,"I have a history of making niche websites and it was my main source of income up until about a year ago when I made a bit of a pivot.  Since then Google has released a couple of updates and it's absolutely annihilated most of my niche content.  

This has been bad for me but great for large content producers like Reddit Medium Quora etc who have all seen their organic traffic absolutely skyrocket in the past 6 months.  Google's Helpful Content Update (HCU) has pushed out a lot of frankly pretty bad websites like mine in favor of content that is verified by other users or from a larger site.  To give you a bit of an idea of the scale of this here is a graph showing the assumed traffic to [Reddit.com](https://Reddit.com) from SEMrush.  This isn't exact and Reddit would have better numbers but it showcases the absolutely stratospheric amount of traffic that Reddit is getting over the past 6 months.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y87yiv0wi4vc1.jpg?width=887&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25a831855089be16e1530816cb8b279d5c7f366e

Now here is Reddit's traffic from their own S-1 form over the past couple of years.  Note that the number of app users in Red increases slowly but the number of non-logged in users increases and decreases in correlation with the SemRUSH graph.  That last little dip before it rockets to the moon is June 2023 which correlates with the logged out drop in Q2 2023 (29.2 million to 28.3 million).  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tvjkdp0aj4vc1.jpg?width=689&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ef51808ae2885cd467ef424c8ec08cbd60af93c

You can see that by **FAR** the largest increase is in Q4 2023 which is only halfway up that SEMrush crayon line.  Reddit should easily see 40 million non-logged in daily users in Q1 if the trend continues.  These users all have a chance to convert into degenerates like you and me but it doesn't really matter because that Daily Average Unique User is going to look sexy AF to investors when RDDT drops it's next earnings.

# But really it doesn't matter how many people log in or view the website because Reddit has never made money and can't monetize it's users.

Well you're wrong about that too.  RDDT is on a path to monetize it's user base and has made a bunch of strides in the right direction in terms of advertising.  Anecdotally the quality of ads I've been receiving has been a lot better in the past year. 

# BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER

Advertising is a marketplace and just like the stock market it goes up and down over the course of a year.  Reddit's advertising is much more tied to the intrinsic cost of advertising than it is anything they are doing internally.  They even mention it in their S-1 "" We experience seasonality in our business and financial results. Overall advertising spend tends to be highest in the fourth quarter of each year due in large part to end-of-year advertiser spending and lowest in the first quarter of each year. In addition we believe our strong growth in prior periods has made it difficult to evaluate the impact of seasonality on our business and we expect seasonality to become more pronounced in the future as our business matures. ""

To draw this out in a format you're used to you can check out this chart from Ezoic. I really dislike the company but I do love their Ad Revenue Index which showcases your expected earnings showing display ads on a website.  This chart is a bit funky to read but essentially it takes the highest mark on the day where you would expect to earn the most and then relates every other day to that.  

So as someone with a niche site the best day for expected revenue was in November of 2021.  This was towards the end of Covid when the market was gearing back up money was free and Christmas was just around the corner.  That's why Q4 (November especially) is always the best for advertising companies (Christmas) and then it absolutely shits the bed in the New Year.  This happens EVERY year except for this one.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q4o0d1tzl4vc1.jpg?width=1138&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95981bd9688da43c2b063010dad77086e8ec0ac5

You can play around with it here.

[https://nicheindex.ezoic.com/report#niche](https://nicheindex.ezoic.com/report#niche)

This year there was the expected Christmas boom and then New Year hangover but ad revenue is actually at the same or higher level than it was in November of last year.  This is unheard of and absolutely not the norm but it relates to Christmas being a bit poor for advertising revenue this year while Q1 has actually been a bit strong for advertisers.

Now how does this relate to RDDT?

Well let's take a look RDDT's revenue has been rising every year but it's Revenue is directly tied to the expected ad revenue.  If we pull their Quarterly Results of Operations data from their S-1 and take a look at 2021.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5xnmh7crm4vc1.jpg?width=1255&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b97e1f962c1e39c8ba3f9b71354cf31c9e1e869e

In 2021 RDDT's revenue was 79 million for Q1 108 million for Q2 121 million for Q3 and 177 million for Q4.  This directly correlates with the ad revenue index where we would expect ad revenue to be roughly double (\~40th percentile to the \~80th percentile).  Then immediately into Q1 of the following year revenue drops from 177 million to 146 million which matches what we  see when comparing the chart.

Now what's interesting about this is that in 2024 we don't see that expected ad revenue drop in our ad revenue chart in fact Q1 of 2024 might actually have a higher expected ad revenue than Q4 of 2023 especially in February and March.

So what happens when the Daily Average Unique users jumps up because Google has skyrocketed the organic users AND advertising revenue is higher AND you've improved your advertising platform?

Rocket meet moon.  RDDT is going to post a similar or larger revenue number to Q4 of last year showcasing 50+% revenue growth year over year and it's second profitable quarter in a row. Last Q1 they posted a revenue of 163 million this Q1 I expect it to be right around the 250 mark and with revenue growing at three times the pace of costs this earnings report will knock your socks off.

`In April 13 2024 Ms. Wojcicki notified members of the special committee (the ""Special Committee"") of the Board that she is considering making a proposal to acquire the Issuer in a potential go-private transaction. Ms. Wojcicki indicated that she was working with advisors and intended to begin speaking to potential partners and financing sources.

If this cancer trial comes out with positive results the current market cap of 172.06 million dollars would be an egregious undervaluation.

2024-04-17 22:45:05,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along pulling down tech. 

This of course is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note on non-news days it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to) stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs) as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts keep in mind that this low-volume existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now. 

‚Äî-
Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15000 in OTM puts they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation CPI consumer discretionary spending is slowing etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right and I hit the mark about a week early but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high GDP still high disinflation has stopped and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1 people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp owners of Tommy Hilfger Calvin Klein is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N) opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N) opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported) anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately** the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH LULU etc.). In fact $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140 stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response and therefore full blown war) continued poor inflation data etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

(Note: I know that I am massively wrong about my predictions with SPY and QQQ in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17owsky/dd_scary_fast_to_a_recession_next_year/) but the AAPL prediction did come true? See P.S. below for more details)

# Introduction

""If he sends reinforcements everywhere he will be everywhere weak."" - Sun Tzu

As mentioned in a previous post Apple (AAPL) is currently trying to defend its market position in multiple fronts:

1. Lagging hardware sales in Macs and iPads globally which compose Apple's ecosystem beyond the iPhone
2. The Greater China Region in general which is the iPhone (and other products') #2 market only behind the US itself
3. Services and Software which serves as an engine for growth amid aforementioned plateauing and stagnating hardware sales are currently engaged in legal entanglements with the EU and the US

There is a great breadth of markets both product and geography-wise listed above. But Mr. (Let Him) Cook is only one chef: if there can only be a single story for a coherent market defense a single place where he can go on a charm defensive where will it be?

It will have to be in China where all of the decelerating markets stated above intersect: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-boss-tim-cook-visiting-shanghai-2024-03-20/)

However the main point of the trip seems to be something else entirely - Apple Vision Pro (II): [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/)

Surely the Apple CEO himself wouldn't have the wind in his sail on the sea just to lead with AVP in order to make AAPL strong?

# Supply Chain + Product + Market: Tim Cook's magic.

Long ago Steve Jobs said that ""If It Weren't For Tim Cook The iPad Would Have Cost $5000."": [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3)

In terms of product market fit the iPad is:

1. A great companion device especially if a large screen is needed in a constrained space
2. Is mostly made for content consumption but can do content creation with add-ons or in a pinch
3. Not as convenient as an iPhone in being ""an iPod a phone and an internet communicator""

Guess which product also does the above currently costs in the ballpark of ""$5000"" and is not yet blessed with Tim's Magic?

I think most of you here can guess (although I have doubts if I say ""all""): **the** **AVP today has components mostly sourced in Japan**: [Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Vision-Pro-teardown-Japanese-companies-supply-40-of-parts)

I doubt Tim went to China himself just to secure a second market to a niche device; he went to secure a supply chain to continue making global devices both AVP and existing products.

# The Magic Is No More: The Journey (Back) to the West

However I don't think Tim Cook has made any headway with China: shortly after Tim Cook's trip Apple suddenly pivots to the Enterprise market: [Apple PRFAQ](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/)

This pivot to me smells of inadequate supply chain scale. Coupled with the fact that his next destinations were Vietnam and Indonesia suggests that the talks in China both from the supply and the market side have reached relative deadlock: [APNews](https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-apple-tim-cook-supply-chain-e9a7581a127937a1958bebd434a47f25) [Quartz](https://qz.com/apple-ceo-says-company-is-looking-at-manufacturing-in-i-1851415116)

# M4: Loaded with AI or merely smokes and mirrors?

In another attempt to revive Mac sales Apple is revamping its Mac lines with its new M4 chip now with a ~~rushed~~ accelerated release date. However I don't think it will make as big of a splash as hoped.

AI chips have two primary markets:

* **Enterprise**: Good luck with Apple on that both in terms of internal culture and external competition / legal constraints - it would be a flagrant evasion of sanctions if M4 Mac Minis were suddenly all the rage in China.
* **Personal**: My current bottleneck is having more than 8gb RAM in my Macbook without selling my plasma not a faster chip.

Given that Apple's R&D spend is 22b as of Aug2023 ([BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apples-ai-research-spend-generative-2023-8)) with little to show thus far it's very difficult to how Apple's current strategy is little more than just bandwagoning: Tim's behavior is looking more and more similar to the knee-jerk reactions made by other tech CEO's particularly Sundar's.

# In conclusion

AAPL 5/17 165 Puts x 10

Target price on downside seems to be \~155 by earnings call based on volume spike on 5/3 155 Puts: [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/options/?straddle=true&date=1714694400)

My current view is that Apple will not be able to execute on an AI-based ecosystem in order to differentiate its hardware to an ever-evolving software landscape as that would require relinquishing too much control over its own platforms (see WebKit Siri sideloading default apps you name it) and its current product line will continue to stagnate as others rapidly commoditize and even out-innovate it in a challenging legal and market landscape.

*P.S.: Last time I posted the markets pumped due to Powell doing an interest rate victory lap (dotplot these nutz) which has now failed to materialize. I excitedly await the spectacle that comes next as 10Y3M reverts and unemployment slope goes back up and reaccelerates.*",0,5

Hi all - I am planning on playing TSLA's earnings and am very aware of the need to account for IV crush.

I have been using OptionStrat and using their IV scroll tool (image) to forecast potential IV crush.

Ex. If my hypothetical position has 50% IV I have been scrolling that to say 40% or 30% to see how much IV Crush can affect the value

Questions:

1. Is OptionStrat and their IV scroll/calculator tool an accurate and legitimate way to forecast IV crush?

I plan on investing/gambling (lol) a significant amount of money into TSLA's earnings. I really can't risk my entire sum on silly IV crush if this websites IV tool is not accurate

2. Any recommendations on other IV or pricing forecasting if for some reason you believe OptionStrat is not the best solution out there

3. Just how much IV Crush % can we expect with TSLA's earnings? Looking at Market Chameleon it looks like at most TSLA has not experienced more than 10% IV Crush after earnings.

Is this correct/accurate to assume IV crush won't be more than 10%?

I'd hate to risk this significant amount of money just to blow it if for example IV crush is 20% or 30% and I am assuming 10%.

But I do not know if 20% or 30% IV Crush is realistic or not.

Please help/educate me on this. Thanks.",0,11

2024-04-17 20:05:37,Palantir ($PLTR): Preview of Possible Massive Commercial Expansion Ahead of Upcoming Earnings - Part 3 - DD,"Palantir has consistently offered robust and sophisticated software solutions but deployment challenges have previously hindered widespread adoption. Recently however the company has introduced its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) product and bootcamp training programs enabling faster and more streamlined implementation for customers. These initiatives have allowed some clients to emerge from the bootcamps with functional value-adding products addressing the deployment bottleneck that had previously constrained Palantir's exponential growth. With these advancements the company is well-positioned to accelerate adoption and capitalize on the strength of its software offerings. I'm expecting big numbers on May 6th 2024.

# Previously reported growth rates which were ok:

&#x200B;

[Previously Reported Growth Rates](https://preview.redd.it/ilj8y4jpg3vc1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fc6fcca44b94923450e6171dce5ccf79798228c)

#  

# Analysis on projected commercial growth:

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies often employ subdomains to isolate and manage their clients' data and resources. By tracking the number of subdomains associated with a SaaS product one can gain insight into its adoption rate and growth trajectory. Based on my analysis of subdomain data over an extended period it appears that Palantir a prominent data analytics firm is poised for substantial growth in its customer base and market presence.

&#x200B;

[Estimate based on subdomain analysis](https://preview.redd.it/j0qilgg5h3vc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e6f73baf83f97e48ebae61a0f27b3e0593a0af1)

&#x200B;

 

Even if only half of the additions turn into permanent customers these numbers are going to be massive.

**Here is what I used for the source data of subdomain data:**

[https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/scans/2024-04-15/palantirfoundry.com](https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/scans/2024-04-15/palantirfoundry.com)

First I extracted the data relevant for the analysis‚Äîsubdomains for each snapshot‚Äîand then calculated how many new customers appeared in Q1 2024.

In Q1 2024 Palantir acquired a total of 333 new customers. The monthly breakdown was as follows:

‚Ä¢	January: 81 new customers

‚Ä¢	February: 105 new customers

‚Ä¢	March: 147 new customers

This showed an increasing trend in customer acquisition as the quarter progressed. To forecast the number of new customers for Q2 2024 I used this growth trend. I calculated the monthly growth rates and applied them to predict the number of new customers in the upcoming months of Q2 2024.

For Q2 2024 the projected number of new customers for Palantir based on the growth rates from Q1 2024 was as follows:

‚Ä¢	April: Approximately 198 new customers

‚Ä¢	May: Approximately 267 new customers

‚Ä¢	June: Approximately 360 new customers

Overall Palantir was projected to acquire around 826 new customers in Q2 2024. This forecast assumed a consistent growth rate similar to what was observed in Q1 2024. Keep in mind actual results may vary depending on market conditions company strategy and external factors.

(I personally love $35 7/19 Calls).

Not only does the historical chart for $SIL support this thesis but so does the historical chart for $GOLD and $SILVER ounces. As you can see from the chart below given current gold prices silver ounces should already be priced over $40. What this will do for the silver mining stocks will be unprecedented when silver inevitably plays catch up and that will happen faster than you will believe.

It is time to get your portfolio set for the summer with $SIL calls. Grand times lie ahead. ü•Ç",6,9
2024-04-17 16:47:05,Cicadas are coming to town get ready for the next play gents.,"I know what you guys are thinking what do cicadas have anything to do with making money? 

Over next few weeks there will be a once in a 200 year cycle for cicadas meaning there will be an insane influx of them all around the East/Midwest/south portion of the US. Its estimated that trillions of these cicadas will come crawling out of the ground in droves. The last time this took place was in 1803 when Thomas Jefferson was president. 

Here is a map of the areas that will be largely affected by this event.

With a cicada infestation sure to come next many people are ready to start stocking up on their bug spray. The company with leading market share in this space Scotts Miracle-Gro who owns many companies including Ortho Bug Sprays. 

Now where the fuck can I buy these products if I'm covered in cicadas you might ask?

Lowes Walmart and Home Depot carry these products across the entire nation. Here are maps of their locations in the US for reference.

2024-04-17 09:30:40,Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative,"Hello everyone

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business although the cash position looks strong these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash often cut production fire white-collar employees and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory despite their steady news flow on the topic last year the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic not the ugly X one car sales do not matter only FSD & Robotaxi do the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well as you will see below many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover MS is very silent in the last week even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi BYD and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore Elon is in warmode but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see huge growth will happen in 2026 but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer is actually late

Secondly how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth given the complexity of the topic I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies not private ones. 

In conclusion not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023 being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2 negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

2024-04-17 07:57:57,Ford ($F) possible 20x bagger coming up ü§ë 4/24,"Hello Regards. Been trying to get the word out on Ford earnings for three days and keep getting my DD knocked down so here comes a long ass post in an attempt to get it to stick - because it ain‚Äôt no fun if the homies can‚Äôt have none!

**The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company makers of EV‚Äôs Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th. 

Ford has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry. The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12.

Most recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines. Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150). Additionally Ford is America‚Äôs #2 EV seller. They have a full lineup of vehicles and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE. With the transition from ICE to EV this is very much a growth stock now with **shitfucktons** of room to go. That‚Äôs a lot.

Ford‚Äôs F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1 this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023. And this isn‚Äôt even factoring in the 500k cars and 6.8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined.

**Source:** This guy breaks it down even further here: 

https://youtu.be/ayWtbehZ8zg?si=Z-75W7Fd7MNxiVqb

**Main bullet points that got me in:**

*The Jan 2022 price was $25.87. Currently the price is $12.14. That‚Äôs a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that‚Äôs likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day. 

*Short Float only 3.6% - Dirty hedge scumbags can‚Äôt tank this $10/share and you lose your entire ass in the blink of an eye.

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*Cybertruck FOMO - People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT and not have to wait 3 years to get it. To me this is the strongest case. It‚Äôs like Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 vs Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro. Meta rode the coat-tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023 by providing the non-hype version of a product that does the same shit and even does some shit better.

*Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards. And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded. Currently $14.5-$15+ calls on 4/26 are $0.01 asks. If you look at the options chain a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain. A $3 move means your wife‚Äôs boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is. You can buy him a Cybertruck that he‚Äôll get sometime in 2028.

*Huge Call OI - almost 65%

*Ford is a Boomer Dividend Stock. It‚Äôs a safety net and familiar. Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre all dead a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts. Ford is not immune but better off for sure.

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12.82c and 30k $13.82c expiring on 4/19. That‚Äôs a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes almost like somebody knows something üßê

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above it‚Äôs possible Ford may announce a stock buy-back before or on the earnings call which will raise the share price. So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don‚Äôt hit by Friday. Perhaps that was their plan? The $12.82 looks good though IMO. I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there‚Äôs no WW3 market panic which seems to be fading rn. 

Conclusion: 
Solid Automaker that‚Äôs not going anywhere. Risk-reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat. Boomer Divi stock that‚Äôs also now a growth stock. 

My Positions: 
$14.5c x100 - 4/26
$15.5c x26 - 4/26
$15c x150 - 4/26
$13.5c x23 - 5/3 

Snagging more in shares tomorrow if I can (waiting on a check lol)

Good luck ü§ëü§ëü§ë

 [Q1 2024 financial results | ASML](https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/q1-2024-financial-results) 

 

 ""Our first-quarter total net sales came in at ‚Ç¨5.3 billion at the midpoint of our guidance with a gross margin of 51.0% which is above guidance primarily driven by product mix and one-offs.

I can't think of a person leaving a company and just decimating the competition on the way out while blessing his former employer with the highest praise.

He's saying there is no chance in hell for others to catch up and not anytime soon.

I don't know if this is news but it should be. He's effectively saying AMD Intel and whoever the hell else is thinking about their own chips just forget about it.

Here is why I believe the same thing. Claude Opus which is almost comparable to GPT 4 allows you to have 40 messages a day. That is just dire and completely inadequate for any real workload. And the responses come back in moments compared to GPT.

GPT5 is almost here and I don't think the world is ready for what that is going to be. Sora is already insanely ridiculous with Google's AI Chief Demis Hassabis and I quote "" it could be difficult for Google to draw level with OpenAI's Sora."" And that's ALL GPU's folks.

If one major player or sovereign nation state gives up on the pursuit of AGI they will be behind in a severely detrimental manner.

2024-04-16 22:02:55,Easy 63% gain on your capital in 5 months - ALCC,"

I've not had the best of luck buying calls and puts so the next best thing is to sell calls and puts. I can't do naked calls but cash secured puts are OK. ALCC is the SPAC led by my personal hero Sam Altman and in the process of merging with Oklo. While the final date for the reverse merger is set for July 12 things could happen and delay a bit. 

In the mean time the stock has been trading around 12-13 range and when you look at the option chains on ALCC you'll notice the rich premiums provided by the long OTM puts. I went ahead and put 25k down (10 contracts) as deposit for the put (while collecting ~5% APR on that cash) and got $16090 of premium to do as I please. If I don't buy any equities with that money in essence I'm getting 5 months of interest on 41k of cash.

From another perspective I'm essentially buying ALCC at $8.91/share or 30% discount on today's closing prices. 

If ALCC becomes huge my 100 shares that I'm wheeling will reap the benefits and I would have gotten 16k for free a 64% return on 25k in 5 months. 

If ALCC bombs and closes below 25 and I'm assigned those 2500 shares as long as the price is above 8.91 in September I would have still made money.

Of course if ALCC super bombs I'll be holding the bag but seriously with a name like Sam Altman instead of Donald Trump I'm pretty bullish that I'll make money no matter what. 

TL;DR position:
100 shares of ALCC

Introduction

Keep in mind the recent price range: $3-10

Company Biography:

NIO Limited designs manufactures sells electric vehicles owns R&D centers and operates battery swapping as a service centers in Norway Sweden the Netherlands Denmark Spain Germany the U.K. People's Republic of China Hong Kong Thailand and pending status for the U.S.A. (through Puerto Rico or Mexico). The company offers five six and seven-seater electric SUVs. It is also involved in the provision of energy and service packages to its users; marketing design and technology development activities; manufacture of e-powertrains battery packs and components; and sales and after sales management activities. In addition the company offers charging solutions including Power Home a home charging solution; Power Swap a battery swapping service; Power Mobile a mobile charging service through charging trucks; Public Charger a public fast charging solution; and Power Express a 24-hour on-demand pick-up and drop-off charging service. Further it provides value-added services such as statutory and third-party liability insurance and vehicle damage insurance through third-party insurers; repair and routine maintenance services; courtesy car services during lengthy repairs and maintenance; and roadside assistance as well as data packages. NIO Limited has a strategic collaboration with Mobileye N.V. for the development of automated and autonomous vehicles; and collaboration agreements with various manufacturers for the manufacture of ES8 a six or seven-seater high-performance electric SUV.

So to summarize:

* Sells and Manufactures a variety of luxury cars
* Offers a multitude of charging solutions
* Offers BaaS in the European Union mainland Chyna and Southeast Asia (Battery as a subscription service meaning NIO owners subscribe and essentially rent out the battery for the car but we'll get to that later)
* Provides vehicle damage insurance statutory and third-party liability insurance (Statutory meaning its required by law to own)
* Offers repair and routine maintenance services and roadside assistance and data packages

Now that's a handful and we don't have all day so we'll primarily be focusing on the main event which is their car line and BaaS. This does not mean you should disregard the other packages when viewing it as an investment it just means I'm too lazy to do research on the other things.

Market and Competition

Market

Honestly pretty much everyone knows where the EV market is heading and how it's the future but it's worth mentioning regardless.

The EV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21% and hit 30 Million Cars worldwide by 2030. By 2026 worldwide EV revenue is expected hit roughly half a trillion USD or $500 Billion. (Also for those who aren't sure what a CAGR is it means that the market on average is expected to grow by 21%. Not overall but 21% year by year; take a second to appreciate the compound growth effect that will occur.) What's more is that the Asia Pacific market (Where NIO primarily is) is reported to have the fastest growth. Here's a graph that represents these projections.

If we take a more specific look to NIO's market analysts have recently upgraded previous forecasts now claiming that 20% of the vehicle fleet will be EV by 2025. Beyond that the forecasts for 2035 and 2050 are 53% and 80% penetration respectively.

Strategy

The Chinese EV market has quite a few players on the board so strategy is pretty important to differentiate and forge a unique business model. Nio's strategic goal is to have a consistent stable order flow rather than a fluctuating order backlog similar to Tesla. (Courtesy of J.P Morgan) By keeping pricing steady Nio's focus lies on services and customer experience driving a positive reputation in the community and keeping engagement high; it also allows gross and vehicle margin to find stable ground as volumes rise.

We could also discuss their consumer relationship and how their dealerships double as community grounds for owners to hang out.¬†Apparently¬†Nio has even more of a cult then Tesla but I don't have the experience to confirm that. Regardless between their own app for owners special owner events and communal spaces it is clear that Nio strives to form a strong and loyal customer base.

BaaS. Battery as a Service. Or rather a subscription. Nio has chosen to distribute batteries in a non-traditional manner electing to not include it with the sale of their vehicles and instead letting consumers chose and rent batteries depending on their personal needs. This shaves off roughly $10000 off the price of their vehicles which in turn boosts Nio's price competitiveness and demand. Also BaaS acts as an additional revenue source for Nio that will continue to generate cash by nature even if sales take a hit. Nio has hit roughly 1 Million battery swaps thus far and these swapping stations even support the EV's of other automakers. This flexibility of compatibility with other EV's makes Nio-power (The battery swapping stations) much easier to scale. You may be thinking does this benefit the consumer in anyway? Sure it does. The custom battery solutions offer a chance for consumers to cater to their own needs. Some people aren't able to have their own home charging stations; many don't even have a consistent parking spot they can rely on daily. Also consumers can customize depending on their own driving habits; if you can't afford to bleed money on certain battery solution downgrade. Going on a large roadtrip? No problem just rent a larger battery size. However the most appealing benefit to consumers is the protection from battery degradation. Instead of being stuck with a dated or low-end battery all Nio vehicles use the same size of battery. What does this mean? Well basically you don't need to worry about the value of your battery depreciating as new advancements make it absolute. Consumers can upgrade to the latest and most powerful battery pack and one size fits all. This improves resale value and provides a future proof battery system. Overall the BaaS may attract a decent amount of controversy (it does have some drawbacks that I touch on later) but I'm personally a fan because it's very pro-consumer improves brand visibility (There's hundreds of these things and other EV's can use them attracting more traffic) and offers Nio Inc. another revenue stream. To recap: Extra revenue stream easy to scale brand visibility and very pro-consumer.

Another thing that's worth mentioning is that the European Union and Chinese governments both favor BaaS companies when it comes to benefits so there's that too.

Catalysts

I don't actually have a lot of research in this area so if anyone in the comments recalls a catalyst or two share it and I'll add it in.

* European Union and North American Market Expansion
* Rapid Clean Tech Movement
* New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors
* NIO's recent partnership with CATL and Chyna's largest automakers to produce solid state EV batteries with a longer life
* Speculation: Potential expansion to the American Market down the road. This is pure speculation but there are claims that Nio Inc. has been attempting to formulate an action plan to enter the U.S. Market. through setting up off shore factories in Puerto Rico or Mexico by 2030.

Local environment

Let's take a quick peek at Nio's infrastructure. As previously mentioned they've chosen to offer battery as a subscription service or BaaS for short. Now we've already talked about the strategy and benefits behind this choice but how well are they executing? As of right now NIO currently has roughly 243 battery changing stations in China and they plan to almost double that number by adding 100 more. Additionally they've partnered with the Chinese state's grid to help establish these new battery swapping stations.

This all sounds great right? We've discussed the benefits of a BaaS system and looked over the infrastructure they've established. There is of course a predictable drawback that I should mention. Because NIO has decided to manufacture and run their company this way other markets that lack China's battery swapping infrastructure will be harder to crack into because they will require heavy investment and development to create a Nio-power network that allows for battery swapping. Just something to keep in mind when considering European and North American markets because there has been some buzz about NIO entering those areas. Anyway let's move on.

Now as you probably know NIO is a China based EV company. Why is that a good thing exactly? Well here's why. The Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025. On top of that China is the largest Wind and Solar energy producer in the world and even further they're the largest investor in renewable energies. OK IDGAF where's the relation to cars? It's not super concrete but there is one; these pieces of evidence prove China's firm and absolute take on clean tech and energy. They've been busting their butts and paying and arm and a leg in the cause of clean energy so you know they'll do everything they can to implement it as much as possible. Also it should make you feel more confident in their goals and how large the Chinese EV market is/How fast the Chinese EV market will grow. Actually let's take a closer look at the Chinese environment with some numbers and facts.

* China is the¬†largest¬†EV market in the world representing roughly¬†50%¬†of worldwide sales.

Between these statistics and China's firm stance on clean tech and the EV market we can conclude that NIO's local environment is well suited for growth and stability.

Financials and Numbers

Not gonna do much talking here just sharing some numbers and you make with it what you will.

Q4 Positive Highlights and Outlook

‚Ä¢ Vehicle sales¬†in the fourth quarter of 2023 were RMB15438.7 million (US$2174.5 million) representing an increase of 4.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022 and a decrease of 11.3% from the third quarter of 2023. The increase in vehicle sales over the fourth quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the increase in delivery volume partially offset by the lower average selling price as a result of changes in product mix. The decrease in vehicle sales over the third quarter of 2023 was mainly attributed to a decrease in delivery volume.

‚Ä¢ Vehicle sales¬†for the full year of 2023 were RMB49257.3 million (US$6937.7 million) representing an increase of 8.2% from the previous year.

‚Ä¢ Other sales¬†in the fourth quarter of 2023 were RMB1664.5 million (US$234.4 million) representing an increase of 27.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022 and an increase of 0.4% from the third quarter of 2023. The increase in other sales over the fourth quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the increase in sales of accessories and provision of power solutions as a result of continued growth in the number of our users. Other sales remained relatively stable compared with the third quarter of 2023.

‚Ä¢ Other sales¬†for the full year of 2023 were RMB6360.7 million (US$895.9 million) representing an increase of 69.1% from the previous year.

Investment Outlook

Analyst Consensus

Need a third opinion? This is one of the¬†biggest green flags¬†IMO. These ratings really show how undervalued NIO truly is. Here's a compilation of some price targets from some of the biggest and most influential banks. Please keep in mind NIO's recent price activity: 3-10 (As of April 16th)

Price targets:

* HSBC: $9
* Morgan Stanley: $8
* J.P. Morgan: $7
* Deutsche: $7
* Bank of America: $7
* Goldman Sachs: $6
* Mizuho Securities: $10

Conclusion

Obviously the EV market and the growth opportunity it presents is fantastic especially the European Union market but I'm also a big fan of their strategic approach. Feel free to debate me on that. I've also heard a lot of praise regarding their management seen a lot of fans of¬†William Li calling him a genius and the 'Elon Musk of China'. There's a couple things I've missed in this DD; I probably should've touched on the competition their other services/packages and done a thorough breakdown on their vehicles but I'm really no expert in those fields so I'll leave that to others.

Clean energy + Sam Altman. That is literally the only thing that matters in all of this. Stop overthinking all of the variables. Literally nothing matters in the current market outside of hype.

S-4/A filed yesterday - what that means? Couldn‚Äôt tell you. But you know that guy who created that little tiny thing CHAT FREAKING GPT??? Sam Altmans name is all over this.

‚ÄúOn September 14 2023 AltC filed a definitive proxy statement (the ""Extension Proxy Statement"") with the SEC in connection with its solicitation of proxies for a special meeting of AltC's shareholders (the ""Special Meeting"") which further describes the proposal to amend AltC's amended and restated certificate of incorporation in the form set forth in Annex A to the Extension Proxy Statement to extend the date by which AltC must consummate a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses which we refer to as a ""business combination"" from October 12 2023 to July 12 2024.‚Äù

The merger is planned to happened some time before July 12 or investors will get back ~$10.43/share. 

‚ÄúMr. Altman also (a) has an economic interest in 6035600 AltC founder shares and 700100 AltC private placement shares through his ownership of a membership interest in the Sponsor (but does not beneficially own any shares of AltC capital stock) (b) beneficially owns 519858 shares of Oklo Series A-3 preferred stock held by Hydrazine Capital II L.P. and (c) has an economic interest in i) the 252605 shares of Oklo common stock held by Y Combinator S2014 LLC (ii) the 354177 shares of Oklo Series A-1 preferred stock held by YC Holdings II LLC and (iii) the 55135 shares of Oklo Series A-2 preferred stock held by YCVC Fund I‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know math so can‚Äôt tell you the exact number but Sam has hundreds of thousands (or MILLIONS?) of shares in this. So I would think he‚Äôd want to see this company do well.

Oh yeah did I mention this is the guy that created chat gpt? That thing that even your great grandmother and taxi driver is talking about? Yeah that guy. 

Position: 2k shares

TLDR - Samuel Harris Altman. ALCC to $40 by July or bye bye me.

2024-04-16 20:31:32,Overstock/Beyond (BYON) hasn‚Äôt had a positive day in April yet. üìâ,"In fact its epic 36% slide began on March 27th.

Every day since then has been negative.  Over the past week losses have accelerated as the stock has been losing 4% 5% on a daily basis.

It‚Äôs not clear what‚Äôs causing this as there has been little news regarding this company to move the market so much.

1) Last earnings were reported Feb 21 beating on revenue but losing more money (negative EPS) than expected.

2) Bitcoin? They stopped accepting Bitcoin in 2022. Bitcoin prices have fallen since March but not in such a straight line.

3) General risk-off sentiment especially with money-losing companies amid high inflation & rates? I think this is the biggest reason but almost no stocks even low-quality ones are as badly beaten down as this one.

They are called Securities but really I think they should be called Unsecurities because they arent secured against material posessions (like a house or a car). A similar thing exists for student loan securities.

Since march 2023 these securities have earned 24-25 percent yields... which is not bad. And recently the credit owners are offloading their holdings. Since Q3 2022 there's been 3 offerings per quarter each around a billion from what ive seen.. But in Q4 2024 they offered 16!

2024-04-16 15:22:37,üöÄ $XPEV: The Chinese EV Powerhouse That's About to Make You Rich AF üöÄ," Alright you degenerates listen up! It's time to go balls deep in $XPEV - the Tesla of China (without the lay-offs). Here's the DD from an industry observer who knows the market and the desperation of foreign OEMs:

 üêâ  **CHINA IS BOUNCING BACK** üìà [PMI readings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/01/china-april-2024-caixin-manufacturing-pmi.html) released two weeks ago are looking bullish AF and NEV sales [surged 80%](https://cnevpost.com/2024/04/03/china-mar-nev-retail-698000-preliminary-cpca/) MoM. Plus GDP grew by a [healthy 5.3% in Q1](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/15/business/china-q1-gdp-growth-intl-hnk/index.html). The Chinese are gonna be all over XPEV like white on rice.

üöó **XPEV IS THE TECH KING** üëë These crafty fuckers [""borrowed""](https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/elon-musk-says-chinese-rival-xpeng-stole-tesla-and-apple-codes-120112300398_1.html) Tesla's autopilot algorithms and gave them a facelift 'cause that's how they roll in the land of the red dragon. Their L3 autopilot is already [available across China](https://ir.xiaopeng.com/news-releases/news-release-details/xpeng-expands-nationwide-coverage-xngp-china-market) and next year it's going global. Elon watch your six.

üåç **XPEV IS EXPANDING LIKE A MOFO** üöÄ They're spreading faster than herpes during the prom night. They've invaded the [UAE Thailand and Egypt](https://electrek.co/2024/02/22/xpeng-motors-global-expansion-announcing-dealer-partnerships-5-new-markets/) with their G6 SUV leading the charge. And if you thought ""[Like a G6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4s6H4ku6ZY)"" was just a catchy tune think again - it's XPEV's battle cry for world domination. They're also making power moves [in Europe](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/xpeng-widens-europe-expansion) faster than the Zhukov in '45 giving the Germans a taste of their own medicine.

ü§ù **VW IS THIRSTY FOR XPEV**  üå≠  Volkswagen is so desperate for XPEV's tech they're practically proposing marriage. Word on the street is that VW's entire electric lineup in China is gonna be powered by Xiaopeng's big brain energy. VW can't sell their MEB Platform-based EVs in China without bleeding cash so they're going all-in on [XPEV's engineering nectar](https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/articles/ready-for-next-ev-push-volkswagen-enters-into-agreement-with-xpeng-for-fast-joint-development-of-two-smart-e-cars-18246). We're talking about a massive revenue stream and validation of their tech on a global scale you autists.

üí∞ **BUDGET BRAND = MASSIVE TENDIES** üí∏ [XPEV is dropping a low-cost brand](https://cnevpost.com/event/xpeng-new-brand-debut/) that's gonna make their costs lower than your standards after a night of drinking. They're gonna be printing tendies faster than Jerome Powell can say ""transitory inflation.""

Now here's the kicker - they've even got flying cars in the works. Yeah you heard that right the [Xpeng X2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-xpengs-drone-car-aeroht-voyager-x2-completes-low-altitude-flight-2024-03-08/). But I'm not even gonna elaborate 'cause you'd think I'm smoking the same stuff as Hunter Biden in Forbidden City.

The Beijing Auto Show starts on 4/25 so we're expecting **GIGANTIC** announcements for points 4 and 5 before and during the car show. The stock has been tanking harder than your portfolio during a crypto winter but that's about to change you paper-handed cucks.

**XPEV literally can't go tits up** 'cause VW is gonna come to the rescue if shit hits the fan. I wouldn't be surprised if the Germans swallow XPEV whole with a tender offering in the near future 'cause they're so desperate for that sweet sweet EV tech. 

And if this is my last post just know that the local regulator probably Jack Ma'd me. üòâ

Remortgage your mum's apartment for this 'cause it's time to get fucking PAID.

TL;DR: XPEV 4/19 and 4/26 calls. Literally can't go tits up. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

2024-04-16 15:05:05,COIN to the stratosphere,"A weak DD
So here is the thing. I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reading and listening on the topic of crypto and it made me realize 2 things 

1. After the bitcoin halving which btw is meant to be on 4/20 the yearly yield of bitcoin will be less than gold. This for the highly regarded means it‚Äôs going to be RARE. 

Rarity = scarcity
When something is scarce = demand 
demand = price go up ( big green )

2. Bitcoin follows a power law (picture of the graph)
For us regards this means that bitcoin follows a trend line that is generated using functions of mathematical formulas. Not by human hands!
These lines have been very well respected by bitcoins price over the 15 year period. 
The way in which the accuracy of these lines can be measured is based on regression ( the r^2 number ). In the case of bitcoin and  this model that number is .953 which means that it is 95.3% accurate. To add to this the power law graphic of bitcoin has been the most accurate example so far‚Ä¶ out of any asset that has had power law applied to it. 

So why ramble about all this on here and how does this relate to coinbase. Well if you look at the graph we are very likely to expect a price of 150-200k in a years timeand a million in about 10. The reason I don‚Äôt believe that bitcoin is some sort of trend that will die out soon is because of the recent ETF adoptions of bitcoin. It‚Äôs here to stay. 

Coinbase is considered one of the biggest exchanges worldwide second to Binance globally and 1st in the US. When it comes to users it is second it Binance with a difference of 30 million however it is a lot more user friendly when it comes to new users. With this information imagine what is going to happen when bitcoin breaks all records and will go on to be talked about everywhere. The newbies are going to flock to coinbase and dump their savings into it convincing their whole family to buy in at the family gatherings. 
Boomers are going to flock to the soon to be run all through coinbase with its user friendly interface

Coinbase is a better platform for users who are simply looking for an easy place to buy and sell crypto and those with simple trading requirements that don't need a wide range of trading tools. https://www.coinbureau.com/review/binance-vs-coinbase/#

To conclude. This is quite a long term play. Considering the -20% drop over the past couple days and the halving coming up by the end of this week it may be a good time to jump in. 

I‚Äôm full porting this one.
Best of luck my fellow regards. May your accounts be green and lambo‚Äôs in coinbase blue. ",0,43

At that time only had 2k deposited on my RH account and managed to gain 300 within a month investing in companies than selling the shares within a few days basically swing trading. It's funny how you can see when actually enabled options though. At my peak was up 1700 with only 2k invested in RH and this was after a few days of discovering options. decided to withdraw $500 but the following trading day humbled me quickly with a 1k loss to making me nearly breakeven. This is when I discovered ODTES which is where my downfall started. After all of this that happened the past 2 weeks has been interesting. FINALLY learned that 0DTES are horrible and you REALLY need to be experienced just to make consistent profits which is whyI started buying calls at least a week out from now. Last Friday I purchased a spy call with most of my port and though had bought the dip. As we all know that was not the case. On Monday could of sold my contract for a -20% loss but held now am at a -90% loss with money that I now owe. This is the last week that will EVER be trading options I was much more profitable by just buying shares in a company and I was doing it rather consistently too. I'm only 18 but it stings to lose this money especially since thought I had a head start in life but not anymore. start investing again once have a good amount of savings but as far as options gol never want to touch it again!
TLDR: lost most of my savings on DTES and should of stocked to just buying and selling shares. switched to buying calls a week out but the market crashed. Never touching options again only sticking to shares in the future.",186,178
2024-04-16 13:47:46,UAL & ASML earnings LETS START THIS SEASON STRONG,"IT'S THAT TIME AGAIN!!!!! Earnings season has just kicked off and the companies are already hitting the court ready to show us whether they've shit the bed or not. Let's gear up for a strong start. IT'S GAME TIME BABY!!!!

Today I've got two companies that I'll be gambling on: **UAL (United Airlines)** and **ASML (no one knows wtf ASML stands for)**. Let's get right into it:

&#x200B;

1. **UAL** \- Look when I invest in a company I don't give a fuck about their business as long as they're making money and not heading for bankruptcy. But when the CEO starts pushing their political agenda into their company that‚Äôs when I start getting a little concerned and by a little concerned I mean very concerned. A few months back the CEO announced a goal for 50% of new hires to be women or people of color. I‚Äôm not a racist or misogynist but why push DEI into the cockpits? Call me a right wing extremist all you want but I want the cockpit crew to be chosen for their flying skills not because of their zigzagzirzemza pronouncs. Scott Kirby don‚Äôt give a shit about his passengers only about avoiding labels like racist or transphobic. He‚Äôd rather crash 3452 planes than face such accusations just hire the old white dudes....... This will all backfire planes will be crashing out of the sky and he will be testifying in front of Congress. This ain't looking good‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôll be shorting this tonight.
2. **ASML** \- Everyone knows ASML makes chip-making equipment and they're from the Netherlands. Nothing good comes out of the Netherlands regarding business except Shell and ASML. Now that Shell has moved to London in 2022 ASML is also looking to relocate which has politicians in The Hague stressing. A month ago they started operation ‚ÄòBeethoven‚Äô which is basically this: We‚Äôll give you $2.7B in tax breaks infrastructure investments build a whole ASML town for your employees and many many more things plzzzz don‚Äôt leaveüò≠üôè. You have to realize: the Dutch elections last year gave ASML a lot of leverage. The party that won the elections (PVV) wants to close all borders but 40% of ASML‚Äôs employees are foreign. They really want to leave and are just playing hard to get now and I predict the government will pump this company to the moon just to get them to stay in Holland. This will 99.999% reflect in their future guidance. Expect green dildos tomorrow morning.

2024-04-16 09:15:02,Powell will Spook Markets Tomorrow,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell famously remarked that 'prices of some things will go up and prices of other things will go down' in a 60 minute interview with Scott Pelley.

Powell is due to speak tomorrow at a fireside chat in Washington DC tomorrow at 115pm.

Some things that will be mentioned during tomorrow's speech include:

'Inflation remains well above our two percent target""

'Strong Labor Demand has forced us to maintain rates since last July'

'Higher Prices can persist for longer periods these costs will trickle down to the retail sector'



Unlike the Fed's kashkari who 'jotted down 3 rate cuts for 2024' Powell 'penciled 3 rate cuts for 2024' in a prior speech held on December 01  2023.



Hedge accordingly as any guidance that is inline with what he mentioned in previous speeches could cause an overreaction tomorrow.

2024-04-16 04:55:59,Ibotta IPO this Week- Thoughts?,"Hey all first post here. I don't intend to make this a rigorous DD but I'd like a few thoughts on Ibotta (soon to be IBTA on the NYSE). Their IPO is this week and here are some notes (Source:  [https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-backed-ibotta-plans-ipo-8628185](https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-backed-ibotta-plans-ipo-8628185))  


1. Ibotta is making money with 2023 profit at \~39 million. They were down at \~56 million in 2022. Somewhat surprising that they're becoming profitable; this industry is infamously hard to make money in. Companies like Honey mainly make their revenue through the ad space they sell on their coupon website and through kickbacks from the companies per used coupon volume.
2. Ibotta has a partnership with Walmart which for a discount-friendly physical giant is nice to have. They're working on implementing AI to determine buyer preferences though I remain unconvinced that this is better than what Walmart probably already has with their cyber division. Regardless still a beneficial partnership both ways (Walmart increases customer loyalty/gets driven customers through Ibotta).
3. The IPO offering consists of a total of 5.625 million shares of which  2.5 million shares are from the company and 3.125 million shares sold  by existing shareholders. Ibotta is targeting $76-84 which I think is too much.

In my opinion Ibotta is a good long-term buy due to promising profitability but the IPO price is too damn high given the business fundamentals. I think we could expect $50 by Friday and $40 a week after. Since we don't have the stock available yet I'll aim for 4/19 $55p. Thoughts or am I very regarded?",15,20

2024-04-16 03:29:52,China's Economy Grew 5.3% Q1 - Does this Affect Rate Cuts Here in the US,"China's economy not only grew 5.3% in Q1 but also inched down their unemployment. In my theory a good economy is good for geopolitical tensions as the need for strife is much lower. Happier waters can lift all boats. 

As well this means that we need to continue our economic growth. I don't know china's monetary policy at the moment but I think they are somewhat loose on their policy with lower rates than higher per se. Not an expert here. 

My question is does this increase the chance of rate cuts or decrease here in the US? 

My reason for it would be that with a China on the rise we must stay competitive and loosen policy. That plus the inflation that is now going to be coming in is from geopolitical pressures that will expeditiously make matters worse. How can you punish the American citizen double because of bad world actors? Tightening a loose policy is one thing. Higher gas at the pumps because Iran went off the rails is something else entirely.

2024-04-16 00:16:10,$VFC : The North FaceVans  Timberlands,"## The Turnaround Story

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear apparel and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands including The North Face Vans Timberland and Supreme brands that wouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar to your average American.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changedyou may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019 VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020 they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19 resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023 Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023 resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022 FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022 Steve Rendle the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months in July 2023 a new CEO Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO) was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9% and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023 VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023 and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024 VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11 2024 the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales I believe the bottom is near and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech he strategically positioned the company into different markets such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenureBefore Logitech Darrell was at Procter & Gamble tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose target audience product plan and marketing approach and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure selling real estate assets in Switzerland and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands such as Kipling Eastpak and Jansport that do not align with their long-term ambitions to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management own a significant stake in VF Corp indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia North Africa the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand which is one of VFC's brands alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison Crocs a footwear company with only two brands generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp with 13 brands of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true\&amp;headers=false](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false)""  

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall is $62 but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario price target is >$100 but it's too far down the line to know as of now.   


Hope you guys enjoyed this DD took me months to get everything sourced and organized ! Will make more of these in the future if people here like it.

2024-04-15 20:56:55,More than +50% from bottom to top and straight up for essentially 18 months straight (Oct 22),My point being with how unprecedented and unlikely this run up has been a drop to that same level in the same amount of time is equally as unlikely in my mind (lightning doesn't strike twice etc). Question-- do the bers that seriously think we will go lower than before realistically see the indexes being 25% lower by the end of 2025?

2024-04-15 19:54:16,Counter-Rally ( likely ) Coming Then a Lower Low to Fill NVDA Earnings Gap at $497,"A counter-rally is likely coming after today's huge down move then a continuation sell off down to $497.   
The objective target for the counter-move is around $510. ( This is a previous level of demand that will now be supply as trapped buyers look to exit )  
My (custom) stochastic & RSI indicators have triggered counter-rally signals. ( outlined with the vertical blue lines )  
Bear in mind the market just broke the 50-day moving average. This nearly always means more pain is ahead. So expect the counter-rally to fail quickly ( very likely on a touch of the 50-day moving average from below)  
After the counter-rally is over the sell off is expected to continue to fill the gap at $497 left there after NVDA reported earnings.  


If we simply open with a gap up tomorrow at $510 then the counter-rally will likely have already concluded.  
It is extremely risky to trade against the trend. I'm not recommending a trade here. Just sharing my work.

I have further out projections for what I expect to happen after $497. Will share in due time.  
Good luck everyone and stay safe.

2024-04-15 19:00:38,Donald Trump is taking his $ of DJT - today's resale registration is our ~30 day warning,"\*\*Background\*\*

I was looking into resale registrations one of which was contained in this mornings DJT S-1 filling where they diluted the stock 15% here: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1\_s1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1_s1.htm)

Why would one file a resale registration? Well on Truth Social they are eagerly sharing a quote from the Reuters article where a lawyer says ""it's completely normal to put that up for your stockholders.""

TS post: [https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170](https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170)

So obviously it's not that.

\*\*Theory\*\*

Why else then would the company file a resale registration? It could be because DJT previously did a PIPE and now intends to sell his shares - aka a Private Investment in Public Equity. SEC explainer: [https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25\_2006/pinedo\_tanenbaum\_pipefaq.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25_2006/pinedo_tanenbaum_pipefaq.pdf)

But why would Donald Trump put MORE money into his failing business?

Answer: He's not he's extracting his $$$ through the abuse of an otherwise common financial instrument.

FIRST - Trump agrees to purchase some large number of additional shares for a ludicrously low price. 

""But blackout periods for selling PIPE shares!"" > at the discretion of the issuer

""But never agree to low price / it's fraud!"" > price solely agreed between investor and issuer. He could even choose a variable price like ""50% of the current value of shares.""

""But PIPE shares are legended! Rule 144!"" > Only before the the resale registration becomes effective Afterwards sell away.

""But you'd have to say something to someone!"" > They just did and afaik the only two reporting requirements are to say what shares are up for resale and who the Shareholders are (did it).

SECOND - Wait 30 days for the resale registration to complete at the SEC using the dilution component of the S-1 as a red herring to keep people off the scent of the real scam.

THIRD - slide all those PIPE purchased cheap ass shares into the market all stealthy like. His other 150 million shares go to zero but (1) they only existed so he could use his control of the company to abuse PIPEs (2) zero was going to happen anyways.

DJT falls faster than any institutional investor expects because Trump uses norms built into standard practices to supercharge his scams.

2024-04-15 16:08:15,PAA - Two Ways to Play in 2024,"There are a couple of DD's out there already around PAA (""Drill Baby Drill! Possible 25 Baggers"" AND ""PAA - Why it can go high even if oil doesn't"") and I don't disagree with their logic of call leaps for '25 and '26. I bought $20C 8/16 and made a quick 330% profit but the more I looked into midstream companies in 2024 I believe most are going to take a bit of hit in Q1 and Q2 before they start to climb. I think PAA could possibly be at $20 by the end of year however based on several data sets and industry articles that I'm looking at I believe it's going to dip before it climbs in Q3 and Q4. That's why I think there are two ways this should be played. My current positions are listed at the end of this thread.

Midstream companies benefit when production is high. They have contracts in place with upstream companies but these contracts are tiered based on production so to an extent these contracts protect them when production is down BUT they do much better when production goes up based on the tiered structure of the contract.¬†Based on Frac Spread and Rig Count (see below) I have some concerns around production and how that will impact midstream companies in Q1 and perhaps Q2.¬†

**Frac Spread**

What is it? Measures the number of crews actively performing hydraulic fracturing of shale in the US. It's a leading indicator of oil production. Midstream companies like PAA thrive when production is high.There was an increase in fracture spread in February but my concern is looking at Total Frac Spreads (Year/Year) 2024 compared to same time 2023. The decrease in Frac Spread in January and March of this year compared to last year is of concern and for the first two weeks of April this year. Production is way down compared to this time of year. Same with Rig Counts (see below)¬†Frac spread decreased by 227 compared to prior year same quarter and decreased by 153 compared to Q4 2023.¬† 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nzczrcdv1ouc1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dc206826bda2ea0e001b9281b211dda5a2093dc

**Rig Count** 

What is it? Weekly number of drilling rigs exploring for or developing oil or gas in the US and Canada. Again just like Frac Spread there is a large variance of total rigs in 2023 compared to 2024. 

https://preview.redd.it/yqwfn8vw1ouc1.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=33519546acc2b3fb95dd24b44a8c0f3101b09b42

[https://www.aogr.com/web-exclusives/us-frac-spread-count/2024](https://www.aogr.com/web-exclusives/us-frac-spread-count/2024)

Oil Prices Although oil prices are starting to climb in Q2 they were relatively low in Q1. Midstream oil companies typically do well when oil prices are high. 

https://preview.redd.it/12vr3cky1ouc1.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b90b053824d847e62fab1a25808a378eda3fcd6

Again I do believe that PAA could see $20 at the end of the year but I think Q1 results are going to meh and potentially Q2. Keep an eye on frac spread rig count and oil prices. If all three start to increase then PAA will have a good year but I'm skeptical on it until I see all three of those heading in a positive direction. AND I do believe all of those indicators (frac spread rig count and oil prices) will trend in a way that will benefit PAA stock price. I'm just not there yet.  I closed my shares a few weeks ago and I'm in on puts and then calls and shares it is when I start to see these numbers heading in the right direction. Leaps are still cheap but I'm waiting to see how much this goes down before buying calls to determine a strike price. ¬†This is not financial advice.¬†Just slightly (perhaps fully) regarded and how I think this will play out this year.

2024-04-15 15:05:33,Why the $TSLA dam will burst at $166.50,"Don‚Äôt worry this isn‚Äôt technical analysis (I already ate all my crayons). 

Elon got levered to his substantial tits through his Morgan Stanley bankers borrowing against the value of his TSLA shares. Then he borrowed even more to buy Twitter which he didn‚Äôt realize put all his wealth at stake until it was too late. So he tried to back out but the courts said no. 

Now TSLA has declined by almost 50% from its peak and oh yeah the Delaware court threw out his $55B pay package as unfair. So he doesn‚Äôt even have a lot of the shares he borrowed against and the stock has tanked and he hasn‚Äôt been able to get SpaceX public and he is fucked and all his shares will go to Morgan Stanley if the stock gets below the price on his margin loans. 

That price? $500. But it‚Äôs $165 you say! Yes but back when you were in middle school the stock split 3 for 1. $500/3 = $166.66. 

The stock has never made it to the options close (which includes after hours) below $166.66. That‚Äôs because Elon and MS have defended it to avoid disaster. It is now below $166.66. 

Will it close below? I don‚Äôt know but you can only defend a stock (probably by buying calls that force trading desks to buy stock to hedge increasing your risk) for so long and we‚Äôre one bad market day from the dam bursting. 

Long deep out of the money puts short the stock sell calls.

2024-04-15 14:25:43,Trump Media ($DJT) - Discrepancy in Outstanding Shares vs. Insider Holdings and Float," I've been looking into Trump Media ($DT) and noticed some discrepancies in the reported numbers of outstanding shares insider holdings and the float. I'm hoping to get some insights from the community to better understand what's going on.

According to the information I found:

* Trump Media has 136 million shares outstanding
* The float (shares available for trading) is 36 million
* Insiders hold 100 million shares

However recent reports suggest that insiders have sold 150 million shares. This doesn't add up as the total insider shares sold exceed the total shares outstanding by 14 million shares.

I'm trying to wrap my head around this discrepancy. Where are these extra 50 million shares coming from? Are there any recent filings press releases or other sources that could shed light on this situation?

I'm looking for fact-based insights and explanations rather than speculation. If you have any credible sources or data points that could help explain this discrepancy I'd appreciate you sharing them.

General Dynamics looks like a fantastic investment right now with a perfect storm of escalating conflict in the Middle East munitions demand that has scaled up tremendously over the last year and a record backlog.

* **General Dynamics' products such** as the NATO-standard 155mm shells primarily the M795 are in high demand due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. These 155mm shells can be highly explosive precision-guided armor-piercing or high fragmentation showcasing the company's versatility and ability to meet diverse military needs \[1\].
* **Exhausted Inventories and High Production Goals:** U.S. inventories of the M-777 Howitzer which uses these shells are depleted with significant quantities sent to support Ukraine. The U.S. has set ambitious production targets to increase 155mm shell production from current levels to 100000 rounds per month by the end of 2025[ ](https://www.gd-ots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/155mm-NextGen-202007.pdf)\[2\].
* **Record Financial Performance:** General Dynamics recently reported its highest quarterly and annual revenue and earnings. With a net earnings increase and a record backlog of $93.6 billion GD's financial health is robust signaling future solid performance[ ](https://www.gd-ots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/155mm-NextGen-202007.pdf)\[3\].
* **Continued Investment and Development:** To meet current and future demands investments in production capacity like the expansion in Scranton and new lines in Texas and Canada are underway. The latest developments in ammunition technology are also expected to start full-rate production within the next five years keeping GD at the forefront of military technology.
* **Record Backlog:** GD's backlog reached nearly $94 billion at the end of the year marking the highest year-end total in its history. This robust backlog indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and underpins the company's financial health \[4\].
* **Global Defense Demand:** The potential conflict between Iran and Israel has heightened the global demand for military equipment. As tensions escalate countries seek to bolster their defense capabilities which benefits manufacturers like General Dynamics known for its diversified defense products \[5\].

With its strategic position in the defense sector General Dynamics is poised for success. Their increasing production capabilities and strong financials make GD calls a clear and confident choice for investors.

\*This is not financial advice.\*

TL;DR - Buy morally compromised calls that might just be 5 baggers.

2024-04-15 02:13:27,TSLA earnings ,"I see Tesla going either way however I‚Äôm leaning towards the bearish side. Few statistics I found to make my decision. 

1- Their car delivery numbers were disappointing only delivering 386810 cars versus analysts expected 433371 representing a nearly 11% decrease QoQ. Even with the new cyber trucks their deliveries still plummeted leading to a 9% drop in price. A as growing company not sure how they pulled of this of but very bearish. 

2- Teslas new car the Cyber truck has been incredibly underperforming and users say it‚Äôs dying way faster than it should especially when carrying large loads (what it‚Äôs designed for)
Edit: saw this right after postingüòÇ 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/E53YkLsAIE

3- We have seen a very slow EV market recently with most companies shares falling or just collapsing as a whole. Rivian and Lucid are on their way with Lucid only being held up by Saudi funding even with billions of net loss and debt. We saw Fisker declare bankruptcy. While Tesla is still leading this sector EV is down 37% in the last year. This leads into my next point‚Ä¶

4- With the slow EV sector and many companies collapsing we still see a handful of companies going up and competing with Tesla. Such as Xiaomi which created a new car (comparative to teslas model 3) costing only 29900 (nearly 10000 less than the model 3). While Tesla reported poor sales we saw BYD sell 300000 cars in march versus 122230 in January AND February. Li Auto delivered 4400 more vehicles than its 76000 Q1 estimate. Also EV companies have been changing the market. For example NIO announced a possibility to trade in gas cars for EV. BYD has been slashing prices and growing overseas sales. XPeng has doubled incentives on its SUV. And more. So with all these companies succeeding why is Tesla lagging?

Now of course Tesla is not totally terrible. They have been pretty innovative recently too. 
 
1- They just announced the robo taxis coming in August of 24 which would open up a whole new branch for Tesla and increase profits (if it works). This isn‚Äôt all the new tech they are unveiling. They have released the cyber truck and semi truck along with having the model 3 be around 10000$ cheaper than an average new car right now. These tech advancements are proving valuable for Tesla. 

2- I think this is the biggest bullish flag for Tesla. Their near monopoly on self driving and the tech that comes with it. I rememberer driving in one a few years ago and its auto pilot could only do highways. I drove in one the other day and it could do anything. Switched lanes at a light because it was 1 car faster. They are the main company when it comes to self driving and this is due to the 22.5 billion miles Tesla cars have driven. Every one of the miles is mapped out by Tesla to train its self driving. Other companies may and have tried to replicate this self driving and while it may be easy to make it the training is very difficult. Tesla has this training however somewhat lacks in the tech industry compared to companies like Nvidia. Nvidia has a self driving sector however they and all other self driving companies need Tesla. For a complete self driving AI you need 3 things: hardware software and data. Nvidia has the hardware Nvidia and Tesla have software however only Tesla has the data. This shows their monopoly on the data portion and currently domination of self driving. I expect it to stay this way for a while and if they decide to partner up with say Nvidia it‚Äôs even more bullish. 

3- One more factor I think could go either way is Tesla layoffs. They just announced potential layoffs of 20% of the workforce and we saw when Meta and Google did this shareholders loved it. However if they want to make their robo taxis they need more workers. On the other hand might replace workers with robots. Kidding but I think this could be bearish or bullish. 

In conclusion I think Tesla is bearish for earnings due to deliveries and other EV companies still making it work in the poor markets while Tesla is not. However on the long term I see Tesla going back up to where it used to be as it dominates the self driving sector. What do you guys think?ü§î 

This is NOT financial advice but position are 4/26 150$ put and 8/16 75$ put for robo taxis most likely being delayed. Longterm just have shares. ",31,47

iOS 18 is going to be the most secure iOS to date using AI heavily to protect the device and its code from being hacked via present methods. (Yes your iPhone fully updated to 17.4.1 is still hackable I have witnessed it myself firsthand trust me Apple is aware and working on fighting this method being used!üòÄ) 

My prediction if you haven‚Äôt noticed already Verizon is very Apple oriented with their plans. WHAT IF the AI was a carrier specific option?! Not only would the network be more secure by utilizing AI but it would make Verizon stand out in ways they missed in 2007 when AT&T took on the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù. 

AI in an iPhone is the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think Verizon would pass this opportunity up at this point. Now if I‚Äôm correct Apple could choose its protected networks worldwide that align with their privacy policies. (Glares are T-Mobile privacy policy page from archive.org) 

This could be a 51% buyout in Verizon as well? Apple gave up on the car why? To keep pursuing the iPhone!!

South Africa recalls J&J's cough syrup sold in six African nations after suspected toxicity
Reuters 2024-04-13T14:47:00-04:00
April 13 (Reuters) - South Africa's health regulator said on Saturday it is recalling batches of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.NaE) children's cough syrup after detection of high levels of diethylene glycol.

The affected batches were sold in South Africa Eswatini Rwanda Kenya Tanzania and Nigeria the statement added.

The recall follows a report by the regulator's Nigerian counterpart on Wednesday which first detected the toxin in a batch of Benylin Paediatric Syrup.

Kenya and Nigeria have already issued recalls for the same syrup which is used in the treatment of hay fever and other allergic conditions affecting the upper respiratory tract.

Kenvue (KVUE.NaE) which now owns the Benylin brand after a spin-off from J&J last year did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

High levels of diethylene glycol in cough syrup has been linked to the deaths of dozens of children in Gambia Uzbekistan and Cameroon since 2022 in one of the world's worst waves of poisoning from oral medication. (Reporting by Utkarsh Shetti in Bengaluru Editing by Nick Zieminski)

2024-04-14 22:49:22,This week's game - buy to win this earnings season,"My thoughts on coming week:

* Iran/ Israel Tensions: Iran made a move that seemed to satisfy their domestic audience without causing any real damage. It played out about how I expected with the markets reacting skittishly and dipping a bit but also providing some good buying opportunities.
* Earnings Season: Earnings reports were spectacular but banks got caught up in Iran's saber rattling
* Inflation and Rate Cuts: The volatility is likely to persist over the next several weeks as the inflation picture becomes clearer (it appears to be coming down) and the timing of rate cuts by the Fed (potentially June or July) becomes more certain.
* Overall Outlook: Despite the recent choppiness this remains a fundamentally strong market backed by a robust economy. My advice would be to take advantage of the volatility and Buy! There seem to be some solid opportunities emerging.

We are in the third innings of a bull market that's just started.  Buy!

&#x200B;

The fray between Israel and Iran has ruffled the feathers of traders and tycoons alike.  
You should remember that oil was already prancing around $90 a barrel due to snug supply-demand antics and some expect this latest act of hostility has tossed a hefty log onto the fire.

Iran's bold strike‚Äîa direct jab for once rather than through the shadowy limbs of proxies‚Äîhas marked a new chapter in this age-old drama.

This escalation could send oil prices leaping out of their boots when trading resumes in New York later today (18:00 ET).

Giovanni Staunovo an analyst at UBS Group AG:

>Oil prices might spike at the opening as this is the first time Iran struck Israel from its territory. **How long any bounce will last will also depend on the Israeli response.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ndrxwilkeiuc1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa8c035308e26a7dbc9f2b5e23b2b034ed22cbc7

&#x200B;

The market already skittish now has more to chew on especially with **threats looming over the vital Strait of Hormuz where a fifth of the world's oil flows** as if through the eye of a needle.

Prices which already include a risk premium of about $10 a barrel are poised to push higher warned Iman Nasseri the Middle East managing director at consultancy FGE.

>Prices could add another $2 to $5 a barrel due to **concern of further Israeli reprisals or Iranian interference with shipping around the Persian Gulf**.

&#x200B;

It seems the oil markets are braced for a bumpy ride. As tensions simmer and with OPEC+ keeping a tight lid on production this latest episode might strain global stockpiles even further.

According to Rosalind Mathieson a Bloomberg News Director:

>As with other market assets **the outlook for oil seems to hinge on any Israeli response to the Iranian attack.** Trading resumes at 6pm New York time on Sunday. The risk of a direct Iranian attack on Israel was already at least partly priced in ‚Äî benchmark Brent crude up 17% this year passed $90 a barrel after the strike on Iran‚Äôs diplomatic compound in Syria.

Here's what the smart cats at Bloomberg estimated could happen.  
I should point out that at this point in time we might be moving into the purple band.

&#x200B;

[from Bloomberg Economics](https://preview.redd.it/nvvreyf3diuc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29db1a212dc1e8db614a250d492429cc765f5252)

&#x200B;

On Wednesday we'll get the weekly crude oil inventories (prior +5.84 mln) at 10:30 ET.  
It won't move the markets but people will pay more attention.

As for the closing numbers from Friday:

CL00-USA Crude Oil futures: $0.58 higher (+0.7%) at $85.58/barrel.  
NG00-USA Nat Gas: (0.0%) at $1.77/MMBtu.  
RB00-USA RBOB Gasoline: $0.02 higher (+0.7%) at $2.80/gallon.  
HO00-USA Heating oil futures: $0.03 higher (+1.1%) at $2.69/gallon.

&#x200B;

I won't delve into what each country should or should not do.  
I can only control what I do.

If Israel's response adds a log to the fire I'm building my watchlist for those sectors that are bound to get panicky sellers‚Äîthose who rely on oil prices.

So far I'm planning to short **IBIT** but I will wait to see either a weak open or confirmation regarding Israel's response. Assuming she gaps down I'll wait to avoid an expected initial bounce.

That's the iShares Bitcoin Trust.  
My thesis is that those investors who trust Bitcoin will invest directly in Bitcoin.  
Those who are dwindling their feet in that water through an ETF are bound to get jittery.  
And also it might get more expensive for Bitcoin miners to operate I assume.

I will wait to see if **LUV** convincingly breaks her support at around $27.  
If she does and other airlines follow along I might even go with **FLYD** instead. That's the MicroSectors Travel 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN.

And I will keep my eyes on **OILD** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN) and **OILU** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x ETN).  
Unless the direct conflict turns into war (instead of calculated act-and-wait) I will just play shares and not options since I'm not willing to pay for volatility or not reacting as fast.

&#x200B;

As a short-term swing trader I'll mostly avoid any overnight positions.  
There are bound to be some big trend-follower players that might offload so I'll keep an eye out on which sector they run out first. I'll do this by keeping an eye out on all the SPDR ETFs. Well the top and bottom parts of that list.

&#x200B;

Have a good day.

P.S. I'm certainly not hoping for war. But war‚Äîor the potential of war‚Äîcan move markets and as a trader I play what the market shows me.",27,38
2024-04-14 21:14:43,Predicting SPX w/ Baccarat Board,"I used a baccarat board to chart the daily SPX returns from Monday Jan 1 2024 to Friday April 12 to see if any discernible pattern. The results are quite interesting as a baccarat player.


The Blue Player wins are if SPX was up from previous day. Red Banker wins are if SPX was down from previous day. I did not put a threshold for ""ties"" or trim for any order of magnitude. So if we were up merely 0.01% from previous day that still counts as a Player win. For perspective the absolute value of average 1D deltas this year was +/- 0.56%. 


So if I were to place some bets for the next 2 days (Monday and Tuesday) the bottom 2 rows on the bead plate chart (table on right) looks like strong pattern for Player to hit the next 2 days!

The caveat is that we were in a massive bull run so if we continue trending down this wouldn‚Äôt be obvious here but other charts indicate we‚Äôve got a bit more juice left for a week or 2 of upside before we crash 10% to sub $500 on SPY.

The turnaround story is now a stunning comeback and revenue growth story. The estimate was 154m in revenues and BB delivered an impressive 173m  with 25% growth year over year in the IoT segment. BB is well positioned in high growth sectors with limitless opportunity especially in automotive which saw huge momentum in 2023 for example global car sales numbers were up 28% in China the world largest car market hit 30 million cars. UK sales numbers were up 18% and the Philippines and India broke records with India reaching 4 million cars sold for the 1st time in hitory. In the US market Feb alone car sales numbers were up by a whopping 9.6% over last year same month and Ford EV traction and GM both were at record high. BB stand to benefit tremendously from automotive sector momentum particularly in China since they have brilliantly created strong strategic partnerships with top EV makers including BYD which surpassed Tesla recently as the number one EV seller in the world. Another key BB EV maker partner is Xiaomi they launched an electric car SU7 with preorders started at 10:00pm China time. A surprise firm 30000 orders recorded in 27 minutes. Pre-orders hit 50000 in the 1st 24 hours. Foxconn also is another big win for BB and they are launching heir 1st EV in 2025 with Blackberry QNX inside.

I feel obligated to post this after reading through a few threads and being shocked at the misinformation in this sub.

I believe Tesla is at the cusp of solving autonomous driving. I'll go over some of the points that people are not considering/misunderstanding in the following text.

""They've been doing this for years and it's still nothing more than advanced cruise control."" This misses a huge detail. FSD V12 is fundamentally a different architecture from all previous versions. V11 had 300k + C programming V12 has removed all of this shifting the approach to an end-to-end solution. This has always been the endpoint; end-to-end is scalable and easily trained it learns by itself instead of being programmed by limited humans. Tesla is one of the biggest customers of NVIDIA's GPUs Elon Musk tweeted a month ago (see image attached) that compute is no longer a bottleneck. You could claim Elon is just lying but the proof is in the pudding. FSD V12 has been having a steady and fast update release schedule. We are now in V12.3.4 after several updates. The fact that the software shifted to fully self-learning AI means now you just need two things: data (good diversity non-simulated and proprietary data) and compute. Compute doesn't seem to be a current bottleneck so let's see how the data is looking.

Take a look at the image attached showing miles driven while using FSD. Data that falls under this category is important as interventions are one of the most important data types; it allows you to see the difference between what the software would've done and where the human disagrees. It's straightforward to see why this is invaluable. As you can see this graph represents an obvious exponential growth and it isn't slowing down in the upcoming months. Half the eligible fleet (US and Canada) still hasn't got/downloaded the free month trial. Subscription cost just lowered to $99 a month from $200. People on Twitter are overwhelmingly impressed and shocked at the quality. Whoever has the software I ask you to give it a test drive again if you weren't impressed at first and you'll be shocked.

This amount of data coupled with the compute Tesla has gives the company a SIGNIFICANT advantage in the pursuit of creating a generalized driving solution that is scalable. Tesla has 6 million+ vehicles collecting millions of frames of data a day. No one else has this much access to real-world relevant data no one. Rivalling Tesla on compute is also extremely expensive and without the data to train it it makes no financial sense.

Don't sleep on Tesla I've never seen such a mismatch of sentiment vs technology in my life.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/04/13/iran-seizes-ship-linked-to-israeli-billionaire-in-latest-escalation-of-tensions/

Iranian authorities seized an alleged Israeli-linked cargo ship near the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday morning in the latest escalation of tensions between the two countries.

The MSC Aries is affiliated with Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer chair of the Zodiac Group which reportedly operates the ship.

Iranian forces conducted a helicopter operation to guide the ship to Iranian waters while carrying out an ‚Äúevacuation of personnel.‚Äù

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz subsequently claimed Iran had seized ‚Äúa Portuguese civilian cargo ship belonging to an EU member claiming Israeli ownership‚Äù and he accused Iran of ‚Äúconducting a pirate operation in violation of international law.‚Äù

FORBES VALUATION.We estimate the net worth of Eyal Ofer the owner of the Zodiac group at $24 billion making him the 83rd-richest person in the world.

The vessel is operated by Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company the world‚Äôs biggest container shipping line. It is owned by Gortal Shipping a finance company affiliated with Zodiac Maritime a company controlled by Israel‚Äôs Ofer family.

Iran simply will not attack Israel directly as the US and Israel response would be measured and forceful.Iran has too much to lose to do so.They are crazy but not that crazy.

So Iran seizes an Israeli cargo ship with 25 crew members.This is the first indirect attack on Israeli assets on April 132024.What Iranian proxies do next should make for an interesting weekend.

Or as stated here.

Israel expects Iran to strike in a way that allows it to save face but is measured enough to not arouse an even fiercer counterstrike analysts say. 

The Iranians ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want a total war‚Äù said Amos Gilead a retired Israeli general. ‚ÄúSo they might attack targets that would enable them to declare that they‚Äôve achieved a great victory.‚Äù

Right now pre-merger ALCC public stockholders' main asset is a \~$300M trust for potential redemptions ($10.41/share redemption price as of 12/31/2023).  Based on the equity structure above after the merger and some dilutive options ALCC public stockholders will only have a 17.6% share of the total $311 million in assets.  So what do ALCC stockholders get in return?  A piece of Oklo's future business... so what does that look like?

I don't know and I'm not a finance person or someone in the energy industry but i pretended to be and made a spreadsheet.  Also I know stocks don't trade on fundamentals but thought it might be helpful to think about it this way.

NRC regulatory approval is the huge threshold question.  If Oklo gets approval and their product is for real this company could be huge.  If NRC says nope then the investment probably goes to zero.

In the ""bet analysis"" part below I calculated an Expected Value based on 25% odds of regulatory approval using a discounted cash flow method.  You'll see that this model assumes that Oklo becomes as big as CEG in about 20 years.

Lots of IFs for this stock but I ended up buying 1000 shares at $12.85 on Friday because I think that Biden or Trump will continue pushing nuclear energy and eventually Oklo will get its NRC approval.  Planning on buying another 1000 if it gets close to $11 before the merger.  And then I'll just keep my fingers crossed that Oklo is for realo.

**EDIT/UPDATE:**

- ALCC's financial advisor (Ocean Tomo) did a discounted cash flow analysis of the merger.  Interesting read and it goes into their financial model analysis of the deal (search for ""Aurora 15we Illustrative Unit Economics"" and start reading from there):  

[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849056/000110465924042658/alcc-20231231xs4a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849056/000110465924042658/alcc-20231231xs4a.htm)

- ALCC/sponsor shares are subject to various lockup periods subject to the stock price trading above $12/14/16 for 20 out of 60 consecutive trading days.  Oklo insider-owned shares are subject to lockup for 180 days past closing of the merger.

- SEC's new SPAC rules become effective July 1 2024 so I'm thinking that the merger will happen in June so that ALCC doesn't become subject to the new disclosure requirements.

2024-04-13 16:46:26,What the hell is going on with Rivian?,"There's seemingly major buy pressure for a stock that is still artificially tanking.
Rivian hasn't been doing well as a company since interest rate increases & the price of EV's drastically falling due to competition within their own used car markets and consumer skepticism about large EV and truck mile ranges.

Large institutions owned almost 90% of RIVN since IPO and r holding the bag on major losses. To regain cost basis they have been shorting Rivian into the ground.

Even though it was almost entirely held by institutions during IPO somehow with only a 12% decrease in institutional ownership (some of the only shareholders) this accounted for almost a 70% decrease in price.

While I can only add one image more than half of the put volume is still out of the money by a lot and short interest for this stock is thru the roof at an all time high. if the stock were to rally 10-20% it could put these institutions in a very tough spot & I just don't see the end goal here.

They have a signed contract with Amazon set to deliver 100k delivery vans and the ceo is clear that they will be in an overall positive profit margin by Q42024. They have more assets to liability.

Which leaves me to 1 conclusion. These shak' quant analysts r shorting this stock for coke money.

2024-04-13 11:39:58,üöÄ Discussion on Proximus (EBR: PROX): Dominating Belgium's rational Telecom Oligopoly üöÄ," 

I've got a hot tip for you all that's hotter than a freshly grilled tendie: Proximus (EBR: PROX).

Now I know what you're thinking ""Why should I care about some boring telecom company?"" Well let me tell you Proximus is not your average telecom stock.

First off let's talk about their market dominance. Proximus essentially owns the Walloon market in Belgium while Telenet serves Flanders. It's like they're playing a game of Monopoly and they've got the Walloon region locked down. This oligopoly status means stable cash flows and minimal competition‚Äîa dream scenario for investors.

But that's not all. Proximus is not resting on its laurels; it's investing heavily in the future. They're currently pouring money into installing fiber optics across Belgium. This move is genius‚Äîit not only future-proofs their infrastructure but also sets them up for massive returns down the line. And you know what that means for us YOLOers‚Äîmore tendies!

And let's talk dividends shall we? Proximus is currently offering a dividend yield of a jaw-dropping 18%. Yes you read that right 18%! Now I know what you're thinking ""That's unsustainable right?"" Wrong. Dead wrong. With Proximus' stable performance and dominant market position I firmly believe these dividends can sustain at least a 10% yield for the foreseeable future.

So fellow autists it's time to YOLO on Proximus. Load up on those shares sit back and watch your portfolio grow while you enjoy those juicy dividend payouts.

expected interest rate cuts drove equity prices to increase in the past year. 3 cuts were expected this year i believe? are these priced in? idk but probably yes? but now that core cpi inflation has come in above 2% target it's not clear that these rate cuts are necessary; in fact they may be harmful.

so now daddy jPow has to consider the possibility of actually increasing interest rates while having told the world to expect 3 cuts. would he do this? core cpi suggests that they should. well let's look at history.

in the 70s fed chairman volcker (powell's hero) raised rates to 18% or someshit and basically caused a recession. it was fcking brutal and he ate a lot of sh but in hindsight he became lionized as this prudent economic dude or someshit. powell could act similarly; apparently he cares very much about Legacy according to that fed economist in the bombshell interview on X. however powell is not known to act in surprising ways like this.

meanwhile we are in an election year in which the incumbent (biden) would not benefit from a recession (duh). if powell raises rates he will likely cause a recession that hurts biden. on the other hand if he doesn't raise rates and even cuts them it will help biden bc this will drive equity prices up. does/will he support biden over his supposed admiration of volcker and desire to follow in his footsteps (apparently)?

tldr i don't think powell has the balls. at worst it will be no cuts no raises. in fact history suggests pow will probably cut in which case stocks go bbrrr.

The earnings season will surprise to the upside - very strong.  I believe the market will continue to roll up for the following reasons:

1) The recent hot jobs market is due to an increase in leisure/entertainment and medical workers.  These areas were most affected by the pandemic.  Yes a lot of government jobs added as well - it‚Äôs an election year for the current Uncle Sam.  I believe the current workers above is fully staffed.  Service jobs will flatten and wages will normalize.  

2) AI is just starting and will drive a whole new cycle in computing hardware from phones to data centers.  The electrical grid will require a rebuild.  A battle for electricity is underway between eV‚Äôs and data centers.  Data centers will win as will those companies involved with power generation and infrastructure.   

3) The Fed - get over them.  Interest rates in the United States averaged 5.42 percent from 1971 until 2024.  I don‚Äôt see them hiking & maybe throwing in a token cut.  

4)  The shift to global isolation leaves no alternative but to invest in the USA.  Importing disinflation is over but we have the resources and the digital revolution will drive productivity.  Let Russia and China buy up the gold.  I rather buy the best companies in the world.   

5) We went thru two Bear markets in the past   4 years - many shitty companies were weeded out.   The market is healthy.

Well there it is A lot of people DMd me asking for updates after my DD post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bgg3f3/my_almost_invincible_call_credit_spread_strategy/) where I went over my strategy to sell far OTM call credit spreads on stocks reporting earnings that week. Since today is the 3-month anniversary of the day I started here is an update/story.

It started many months ago Setptember to be exact when I was selling cash secured puts on average stocks like META MSFT etc.. then everything changed in December when I decided to sell puts on AMC. AMC tanked and my puts got assigned so I doubled down and it kept falling. Before I knew it I was leveraged to the tits. Full send max margin in AMC shares which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18wr5vz/the_first_and_probably_last_green_ytd_chart_i/) - a photo of my portfolio is in the comments. Unfortunately AMC continued to go down.

Around January 13th I said fuck it. I sold EVERYTHING at a huge loss. I settled on keeping $58k and went full send into NFLX Put credit spreads barely out of the money. NFLX rose on earnings and the strategy was born.

Eventually I did more research. I made the spreadsheet you see in my DD post and have since updated it further. Also I almost exclusively sell deep otm call credit spreads now because I have found that they give me better risk to reward. Since January 13th and Just to name a few I've yeeted my whole net worth into selling OTM weekly Call Credit Spreads on NFLX LULU ULTA COST DG MSTR SMCI BIDU SOUN DJT and JPM. That's what I can remember right now at least.

I haven't kept track of my total profit per week since I started but here is the last 4 weeks (I know I'm missing some fees in my weekly ending amounts).

There will be IV crush and I am wondering how I can best protect against it while still making a reasonable profit.

Thus far the best potential courses of action I have thought of are:

1. Buying DEEP ITM puts (defined as 10 dollars ITM) with an expiry of 4/26
2. Buying DEEP ITM puts with an expiry of 5/24 or perphaps a bit longer

My questions and confusion are:

1. what is more important in protecting against IV crush - purchasing ITM beforehand or having a longer expiry date?
2. Does it matter how ITM I should be? Is there any big difference between purchasing 5 dollars ITM or 10 dollars ITM?
3. I am confused about theta's impact on IV crush especially since I plan on only holding my options for 1 day

If theta/time is extrinsic value and IV crush only affects extrinsic value really plus the fact I only plan on holding for 1 day or so shouldn't I go with the weekly option?

I have advised some people saying a longer expiry is better to defend against IV crush but I don't understand that because longer expiry = more extrinsic value = more value to be killed during IV crush right?

2024-04-12 18:32:28,TLT Boomer YOLO.,"This is kinda boomer YOLO but literally free money and won't go tits up.

I am a cuck pussy so I can't go full regard like rest of you beautiful autists. I got plenty mouths to feed kids wife and her boyfriend and his mistress and so forth. so I have to play conservative.



Why TLT? Here's my reasoning:

- TLT is giving yield at 4% ish now. About $700 bucks a month so monthly coupon divvy provides continuous fund to gamble on SPY/SPX option

- TLT will not go tits up. Well if TLT does go tits up we got bigger problem then our fake monopoly money

- Nobody know what the rate will be in the short term. But I think it is more probable that rate will come down eventually in the long run. I am long term investor.

- JPOW is fast & furious man. Look at his history taper tantrum COVID cut. He cuts fast raises fast. Faster than you can fap on your wife fucking her boyfriend. So when he cut he will cut bigly.



Price Target

- Market fear & vol could drive TLT down to $80 ish. That's 12% drawdown I am comfortable with that. It's called defined risk. Also I can numb my feeling by keep gambling with TLT divvy.

- When JPOW did cut the rate in the past TLT went to $140+ Thus $140 is minimum target.

- If reason for the cut is some sort of doomsday FUD then it could go to $160+

- Estimated profit at exit is $120K \~ $168K

Best part of this is that if I make money I still don't pay any CAP gain tax because I have abundance of cap loss carryover from my old heavy bags on different loss.

Defined smol risk higher upside & probability. It would be foolish to not to take this trade.

  
Edit: Position 2400 shares of TLT

While its competitors - AMD and NVIDA - have hit the moon and then some Intel is still struggling along at around the price that it was prior to anyone knowing what ChatGPT was. If anyone had the massive foresight to invest in a chipmaker on the eve of the explosion in AI hype they'd have been wrong to choose Intel. Problematic!

There are reasons for this of course. Intel has not come out with a cutting-edge product - Nvidia's H100 has blown anything Intel's been able to offer out of the water. Intel has a notoriously dysfunctional corporate structure. Intel has been since way before this subreddit existed known for being a limp stock that trading sideways. China has been making noises about phasing out foreign chips. All these factors have prevented Intel from achieving the sort of green candlesticks that AMD and Nvidia sprouted as the implications of AI - and the vital role GPUs would play in powering it - became clear.

In spite of all this I think Intel is a strong buy right now. Why?

For one it's at a price we haven't seen in nearly a year. There's been a string of bad - but not structurally undermining - news coming out about the company recently similar in form to the Gemini debacle that brought Google down to 133 a month ago. Google is now at 160 because AI is a hell of a thing to have in your column. The same dynamic is going to push Intel's price up. If you want that in technical analytic terms - RSI is below 30. Buy.

Intel is also catching up. [It's releasing a chip](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-artificial-intelligence-ai-chip-085500073.html) that can beat the H100! That's not the whole story of course - there's rumors that NVDA's latest Blackwell offering will be better than Intel's when they release it later this year. But demand for AI and the chips that power it is only spiking. We're even starting to see LLMs that can operate locally at the consumer level which requires a lot of hardware. Nvidia's already selling out for years in advance - people aren't going to be able to get their hands on the most cutting-edge chips for a long long time. And so Intel is going to end up with a shitload of demand in its lap. 

There's also the national security angle. Intel is the only major domestic chipmaker and America has a considerable interest in ensuring that its domestic chipmaking capabilities are at least on par with other countries. Congress has already passed billions of dollars to domestic chipmaking efforts and Intel will be a major beneficiary as it continues to dispense cash. 

Their earnings call is on 4/25 and so [here's my 4/26 call spread](https://imgur.com/a/kNWdyfT). I expect these to pick up a lot of IV as we get closer to 4/25. We're going to make a lot of money together regards.",644,438

2024-04-12 17:00:43,Bull or Bear? WMT don't care,"Hello fellow degens

	I wanted to post here as I understand the market is experiencing a bit of volatility spike and I know we all just got out of the DWAC/DJT and NVDA trips to space. I didn't board because well I'm really paper handed with trips like that.

While you guys are trying to find the next roller coaster cart to board I'd like to suggest a more leisurely trip. Like a train ride through the county side.

Consider divesting some of your current bag for Walmart or your preferred grocery store to stabilize your gains. I find Walmart has the strongest fundamentals for me.

Why?

Well the Greed and Fear index has been ticking backwards to the point it's riding the fence. And I notice that the CBOE Volatility Index is spiking. This usually means there is a turn rolling back to Fear or a bear market. People still got to eat and go get groceries. If you're waiting for a safe place for stable gains during a period like this turn to the local city market vendors. 

&#x200B;

Greed / Fear Ticker - [https://www.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed](https://www.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed)

CBOE VIX Volatility - [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX)

&#x200B;

The CPI indicates that Foodstuffs and feedstuffs are steadily rising at the beginning of 2024 (though it was -1.5 in January I blame the weather personally) but February and January trend upwards.

America got a bunch of immigrants recently too from what I hear so they got to shop somewhere. 

Walmart has a great supply chain and has been resilient in many the ways America wishes it would have stayed given the current era of ""Friend Shoring"".  Not to be political but to essentially point out that there's government support for this type of business resilience due to the erosion of globalization sourced dependencies. 

Walmart will release it's earnings on May 19th and while there. Given the back tick in CBOE VIX Volatility. I anticipate some bag holders cashing out a portion of their earnings. Rightfully so but if you want to keep those assets appreciating albeit less risky and slower over the next months till you see the next roller coaster you want to ride - consider Walmart / grocery stores with good fundamentally

I've placed my bet on WMT rallying next week given the Greed Fear Ticket Volatility Index and the outcome for intermediate foodstuffs as we're going into Spring/Summer given the CPI. I'm probably missing something. I should tell you my losses to date are about -45k because I was on the wrong side of the original DWAC announcement of Truth Social when Elon was buying Twitter. So for better or worse I'm a part of this group of regards and degens. Much love either way.

2024-04-12 16:01:09,WSB Reactions to Tesla Robo Taxis,"**Recap of What Happened:**¬†

Elon Musk‚Äôs latest claim on Twitter was to announce the long-awaited Robotaxi reveal on August 8th shooting the stock market up early 5% on Monday.¬†

This announcement was posted on X just after news broke from Reuters that Tesla planned to cancel the long-awaited sub-$30000 ‚ÄúModel 2‚Äù electric vehicle once again in order to focus on the launch of the robotaxi.¬†

Elon Musk was quoted responding on X saying that Reuters was ‚Äúlying (again)‚Äù even though this information came from a legitimate and trustworthy source within the EV company.

**Sides Are Split.**

Although Tesla's stock shot up from what I can tell WSB has had very different reactions to the announcement:

**Bull Viewpoint:**

If the shift away from the Model 2 is confirmed some believe that this would dramatically improve Tesla‚Äôs current position in the market. If the EV company is so optimistic on its improvements to its autonomous technology that it has decided to solely focus its efforts on releasing the robotaxi then many analysts see this as a major positive.

Tesla is often valued closer to a technology company than an automotive one and this development surely indicates this will continue to be true. The actual vehicle has never been Tesla‚Äôs main asset but its self-driving robotaxi network which is just now coming fully into focus is its main value driver. Very few automotive companies would be able to imitate this product which would give Tesla very favorable economics.

**Bear Viewpoint:**

On the other side many believe Tesla has sacrificed a key portion of its business labeling the Model 2 as a volume play that would reaccelerate volume and demand for the company metrics that have really suffered in 2025.¬†

In order for features such as FSD or full self-driving to be as accurate as possible Tesla needs more data. To get more data the EV maker needs more cars on the road hence where the Model 2 comes in.

2024-04-12 14:19:51,GoPro is ridiculously cheap fundamentally. ,"I think stock is should  atleast trade at 2-3x the current price.  Market cap is just 200 mil ? 

They have bought at least 40 mil in stocks in 2023. Are you kidding me?

Fundamental thesis: 
- Strategic Shift and Innovation: GoPro has evolved its business model from selling just hardware to combining hardware sales with subscription services and premium services launched in February 2024. This shift towards a more service-oriented model aims to provide a steady revenue stream and enhance customer loyalty.

- Financial Performance: GoPro has shown significant cash generation improvements over the years. For example from an average cash usage of $46 million in the years before 2020 to generating $91 million and $221 million in subsequent years although there was a slight dip to $2 million in cash generation in 2023. Despite this GoPro managed to partially repay its convertible debt and repurchase $40 million in stock in 2023.

- Market Presence: GoPro has maintained its position as a leading brand in the U.S. camcorder market with the HERO12 BLACK being the best-selling camera. The company boasts a strong social media presence with millions of followers and billions of lifetime views on its YouTube channel indicating a robust market reach and brand recognition.

- Recent Acquisition: GoPro's acquisition of Forcite aimed at enhancing the performance and safety of helmets starting with motorcycle helmets signals GoPro's intention to expand its market presence into new segments leveraging its brand strength in motorsports and among motorcycle enthusiasts.

- Subscription Services Growth: The company has seen growth in its subscription services with a notable increase in the average selling price (ASP) of its cameras and a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69% for its subscription services. The subscriber renewal rates show increasing loyalty with more than 80% renewal rate by the third year.

- Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): GoPro highlighted its commitment to CSR with initiatives like employee engagement diversity and sustainability goals. The company aims to source 100% renewable energy for its U.S. locations by 2026 and has disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions.

- Financial Highlights:  Revenue showed a slight decline in 2023 compared to previous years but the adjusted EBITDA remained positive indicating a healthy operational profit margin. There's also a notable shift in the MSRP camera revenue mix with a higher percentage of cameras being sold at prices above $400 MSRP in 2023 compared to 2019.

Analyzing these points GoPro's strategic focus on diversification through subscription services its strong brand presence and recent initiatives to penetrate new markets suggest a solid foundation for growth. While there was a dip in cash generation in 2023 GoPro's ability to maintain profitability and invest in strategic acquisitions and stock repurchases demonstrates financial resilience. Given this context a market cap of $200 million might seem conservative especially when considering the company's assets equity and strategic positioning for future growth. The information suggests that GoPro is actively working to expand and solidify its market presence which could potentially increase its valuation in the eyes of investors looking beyond the immediate financial figures to the company's growth potential and strategic initiatives.",0,126

2024-04-12 14:04:12,Today's game - buy the dip,"**JPM WF and C Report - All Beating Numbers Only C Up - Good Buying Opportunity for JPM**

The market continues to be a bit skittish down about 3/4% at the time of writing.  I had positioned for this trade yesterday by NVDA puts that I closed out to open calls that I will cash Monday. Sometimes you can just print money.

The earnings reports show what I've been saying - good earnings will be rewarded and the market will continue to grind higher. Yes it's a little lower right now but we'll be higher coming out of this earnings season as companies keep reporting strong results.

The key points:

* JPM WF and C all beat earnings expectations
* Only Citigroup (C) stock is up on the reports
* I think JPMorgan (JPM) is a good buying opportunity here

Looking ahead I expect the ""rate cuts"" narrative to return once the next inflation print comes around.

The bottom line is to keep buying the dips. This market is giving a great opportunity to make money so take advantage of it.

PS - yet again some folks reaching out to ask where to put money to work.  So here we go:

* Cybersecurity: this is a growth segment that is very cash rich due to high margin business the large businesses operate in. ZS and PANW are good names to buy before their earnings (expect some volatility)
* Large caps will continue to perform better this quarter but will give way to small caps at some point this year as the interest rate story comes.
* Utilities/ energy are no longer looking attractive but look for natural gas exposure (EQT is a good name).
* Banks: higher interest rates will benefit larger banks.  Buy JPM!

2024-04-12 13:57:07,China is the under-reported factor in the rise of Gold and Silver,"It may have come to your attention that the price of gold and silver has increased significantly over the last month.

There has been some reporting on the issue but mainstream analysis  of the trend is largely limited to the ""usual suspects"" - geopolitical  tensions (check) reckless and unsustainable government spending  (check) and fears about the banking system (check).

All these factors are absolutely relevant. But there is another huge factor entirely missing from the official story.

Gold and silver is traded in futures markets in NYC (COMEX) and London.

It is also traded in Shanghai on the Shanghai Metals Exchange.

Since around September of last year **Shanghai has been paying a significant premium on gold (around 2%) and silver (around 8-10%).** Currently silver in China is well over $30 an ounce.

Now price spreads between COMEX and Shanghai Metals Exchange have happened before but **never for so long and for so much**. (See Shanghai vs COMEX silver price chart here)

Arbitrage should have sorted this situation out by now. Let's ask ourselves why it hasn't.

Markets are carefully and sometimes tightly ""managed"" by the Chinese government.

For some reason they are allowing their markets to pay more for gold and silver than the American and UK markets. **This effectively allows** **China** **to set the price for precious metals and slurp up global supply**  as miners in South America Mexico Poland South Africa ect. can  simply sell their gold and silver to China instead of America.

This is likely an intentional gambit by the Chinese government. It is  probably related to geopolitical tensions between America and China  and Chinese fears that the American government will weaponize the dollar  to undermine Beijing's interests. 

Raw data on Shanghai silver prices is available here: [https://www.sge.com.cn/sjzx/shyjzj](https://www.sge.com.cn/sjzx/shyjzj) (Note these are in yuan/kilo so math is required to figure out the corresponding COMEX prices).

Since my DD Intel has pretty much been shitting the bed selling off anything that would be considered ‚Äúgood news‚Äù and tanking on the slightest ‚Äúbad news‚Äù. China not using US chips in CCP computers? Surprise surprise tank. Intel posting FY 2023 results again -8% lol. Latest one I really liked Intel introducing Gaudi3 as a capable NVDA competitor -3% the next day. 

Now does all of this make sense? In some sense of course the market is always right. In some other sense maybe not so much. At this stock price Intel is trading only 43% above its book value ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/price-book](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/price-book)). This does not take into account the fact that they plan to add 110 billion more to the book over the next 3 years which would make them trade *under* their book value right now. This is fucking huge for a company that essentially makes a pile of their revenue with exactly this book value.

Their latest *AI* processor Meteor Lake is already sold out for some of the main vendors. On the contrary I could barely find any vendor that equips its products with the direct competitor Ryzen 9. No surprise Intel smoked AMD in the 2023 Client Computing segment already. And they are just getting started: their newest processor lines Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake are already to be found in OEM test devices ([https://www.notebookcheck.net/Massive-Arrow-Lake-leak-reveals-Intel-ditching-new-cores-introduced-with-Meteor-Lake-no-Arc-iGPU-and-more.809838.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Massive-Arrow-Lake-leak-reveals-Intel-ditching-new-cores-introduced-with-Meteor-Lake-no-Arc-iGPU-and-more.809838.0.html) and [https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/forget-meteor-lake-samsung-just-leaked-intels-next-gen-lunar-lake-cpu](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/forget-meteor-lake-samsung-just-leaked-intels-next-gen-lunar-lake-cpu)) and they are unmatched by anything else on the market (Lunar Lake providing >100 platform TOPS with even the new Snapdragon Elite only reaching 75). Those chips are already using amongst others the 20A process meaning that they are *ahead* of TSMC‚Äôs process resulting in an enormous performance and efficiency increase.

The big players (MSFT GOOG META) team up with Intel on both the software and hardware side ([https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/26/tech/plot-nvidia-grip-ai-software/](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/26/tech/plot-nvidia-grip-ai-software/) and [https://www.dqindia.com/ibm-meta-intel-sony-and-dell-unites-for-ai-alliance-to-challenge-industry-titans/](https://www.dqindia.com/ibm-meta-intel-sony-and-dell-unites-for-ai-alliance-to-challenge-industry-titans/)) and especially MSFT pushing the cooperation with Intel‚Äôs AI processors hard. With Gaudi3 and this solid software stack getting a grip in the datacenter segment is imminent. People like to compare Gaudi3 to Blackwell but Gaudi3 already ships to OEMs while Blackwell will only be available in limited quantities starting 2025.

So you may call me a degenerate idiot I will take it with the same pride as all of you take it. I increased my INTC position by about 50% after the recent ‚Äúfoundry loss‚Äù dip. As you can see it has dropped further but well who said making money was easy. When others are fearful then there is some blood on the street or some shit like that. However no time pressure with shares which is pretty valuable for a company that is undervalued literally not allowed to go bankrupt and about to fucking bigly enter the opportunity of this decade.   


Enjoy wanking!

* In the lead-up to WWDC I expect AAPL to trade more on news and speculation rather than fundamental business factors. For instance reports of lackluster iPhone shipments in China are likely to disappoint investors again potentially driving the stock price back down towards $168 or even lower.
* I also anticipate some profit-taking from investors who were waiting for this recent price increase to sell their shares.

While I believe the long-term fundamentals for Apple remain strong and the stock will move significantly higher over the course of the year I felt a 4% gain was a good enough opportunity to cash out for now. Investors who maintained a long position have little to worry about but I think the stock may tread water a bit further before resuming its upward climb. Whether to cash out or stay invested depends on one's risk tolerance and investment time horizon.",39,40

Hello.

I just wanted to follow up on my post from a few days ago talking about the Paramount Global merger with Skydance. 

**Background**

Paramount Global has a dual class share structure. Class A shares with voting rights and Class B shares with no voting rights. A holding company called National Amusements holds 80% of the class A voting shares. Shari Redstone owns National Amusements. However National Amusements is in financial trouble and needs a bailout.

**Current Situation**

Paramount Global entered exclusive talks with Skydance and are working on a 2 step deal:

1. Skydance bails out National Amusements with a $2 Billion cash payment
2. Paramount Global acquires Skydance giving Skydance $5 Billion in equity thus dilluting current shareholders by about 50%.

The deal must be passed through a special committee with fiduciary responsibility to all shareholders. However 4 members stepped down. Those 4 members are rumored to be against the merger.

Shari Redstone is doing all she can to save her holding company National Amusement while screwing over all the other shareholders -- almost exactly how she forced the merger of ViacomCBS.

Multiple Common Shareholders have begun threatening lawsuits against Shari Redstone: 

* Gabelli Asset Management 
* Matrix Asset Advisers 
* Aspen Sky Trust
* Ariel Investments
* Blackwood Capital Management 

The ""r/p\\a\\r\\a\\m\\o\\u\\n\\t\\g\\l\\o\\b\\a\\l"" subreddit has now gone private for what I assume is them preparing to create a class action lawsuit. Before the subreddit went private many of the members were also spamming investor relations with threats of lawsuits if the merger went through.

***WINTER IS COMING***

**P.S.** For you option gambling regards: The question is how can one make money off from this situation -- the stock has been extremely volatile and probably will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.",38,15

2024-04-11 18:42:26,üöÄüåï SOFI: The Sleeper About to Blast Off! üåïüöÄ,"Listen up degenerates and fellow regards of WallStreetBets it‚Äôs time to tune into a stock that‚Äôs been flying under the radar but is primed to make some seismic waves. I‚Äôm talking about none other than SOFI Technologies Inc. (Ticker: $SOFI). Here‚Äôs why your portfolio needs this rocket fuel especially with their earnings announcement on April 29th that‚Äôs expected to be a monumental blowout continuing their streak of outperformance.

**üî• The Lowdown on $SOF**I:

**- Mid-Cap Maverick with Mega Growth:** Clocking in with a market cap of $7.38B and trading at a savory $7.56 a share SoFi ain‚Äôt no small fry. With 959 million shares out there this company‚Äôs financial growth spurt is just getting started. Revenue shot up 300% from $560M to a whopping $2 billion! If that doesn‚Äôt scream growth I don‚Äôt know what does. Did I mention they‚Äôre forecasting upwards of $.80 EPS in 2026? ü§Ø

**- Financials on Fire:** Despite Wallstreet neglecting SoFi‚Äôs positive free cash flow and positive GAAP earnings in Q4 and going forward this beast is about evolution. With lending financial services and a proprietary technology platform driving a revenue rocket this puppy is set to print some serious tendies for those with the cajones to hold. Especially when that revenue is launching faster than a SpaceX test flight.

**- Industry Underdog Ready to Lead the Pack:** In a sea of 56 companies SoFi stands out with its beyond-undervalued metrics - Price to Book PEG P/E etc. despite its high growth trajectory. And let‚Äôs not forget while banks spend billions on dying brick-and-mortar locations SOFI‚Äôs lean model means more fuel for the growth rocket without the dead weight.

**- Membership and Product Growth Off the Charts:** SoFi achieved strong year-over-year growth in both members and products in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. New member additions of nearly 585000 in the quarter brought total members to over 7.5 million by year end up over 2.3 million or 44% from the prior year end. With product usage booming and new members flocking it‚Äôs like every quarter is Black Friday but without the discount because SOFI doesn‚Äôt need to cut prices to attract the crowd. Did I mention they‚Äôre now the official bank sponsor of the NBA? Hmm‚Ä¶I‚Äôd bet my wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs car that we hit record new members this quarter.

**- Earnings Explosion Incoming:** Mark your calendars for April 29th because SOFI‚Äôs about to drop their earnings like a mic at a rap battle. Year after year they‚Äôve been knocking expectations out of the park and this year‚Äôs going to be no exception. Get ready for a blowout that‚Äôll have Wall Street's jaws on the floor.

**üåü Why $SOFI is Your Ticket to the Moo**n üåü

**- Blowout Earnings Anticipated:** The word on the street (and by street I mean the data-driven corridors of finance nerds) is that SOFI is about to blow the roof off with their upcoming earnings. They‚Äôve been beating expectations like it‚Äôs their job (well it kinda is) and April 29th is going to be a show you don‚Äôt want to miss.

**- Rapid Growth in a Booming Sector:** Financial tech isn‚Äôt just the future; it‚Äôs the now. SOFI with its digital-first approach is poised to dominate. Membership growth product expansion and strategic acquisitions like Galileo signal a company on the move not content with playing second fiddle. It‚Äôs a matter of time before their tech platform takes off. They have a deep pipeline and have a top 5 US bank \*\*cough\*\* CITI Bank \*\*cough\*\* going through a proof of concept. They‚Äôre being overly conservative with their 20-25% annual tech revenue growth.

**- Valuation Vindication on the Horizon:** This is like paying $.30 for $1. Bargain hunting baby.

**üîÆ Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Sleep on SOF**I üîÆ

In the world of stocks SOFI is that hidden gem glittering in the rough waiting for the discerning eye to recognize its inherent value. With explosive growth industry-leading metrics and an earnings report poised to shatter ceilings SOFI isn‚Äôt just a good investment; it‚Äôs a portfolio cornerstone for those looking to ride the next wave of financial innovation.

So strap in fellow WallStreetBets warriors. It‚Äôs time to add some SOFI to your stock arsenal and prepare for lift-off. The countdown has begun and April 29th is just the beginning. To the moon SOFI! üöÄüåï

Now this is something I believe is normally reserved for day trading and even with that a chart doesn‚Äôt mean shit if there‚Äôs not good news surrounding it. The good news however seems to be in abundance for them. McMahon is gone recent WWE event had record numbers UFC 300 incoming (though I expect this to only be a shorter term juice) Netflix deal from January growing viewership and a sweet succulent earnings report in the first half of May. All of this in combination with the potential of a big run after a golden cross has me feeling bullish about their direction even if only for the short term.

3rd and final round. Only 3 because idk how I would do a 5 prong championship round discussion. Over the past month they‚Äôve seen an average weekly increase in the value of their stock of ~$4 per share.  Can a pace like that continue? Not very likely but even if that were to be cut in half I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs completely insane to see this stock get back to those 115 highs by earnings or even right after. I also think the value of that Netflix deal can give them a stronger forecast.

Playing this through earnings only so I‚Äôve grabbed May 17 105C. I‚Äôm still regarded and don‚Äôt know how I can include more than one picture. 55 contracts at average cost of 1.81. $9937.23 total on the line. 

Good luck to anyone currently holding or thinking of jumping in. And if you have reasons why they won‚Äôt continue to rise please share your thoughts as maybe I‚Äôve missed some important factors.

2024-04-11 17:42:25,SSR Mining - Bullish channel break after bad event,"**Here's a quick rundown about SSRM:**

* Current  market cap is 25% of fair value of assets. Current cash is 44% of cap.
* Owns  and operates mines in Nevada (Marigold) Saskatchewan (Seabee) and      Argentina (Pirquitas)
* Formerly known as Silver Standard Resources
* Recently faced a landslide at their √á√∂pler mine in Turkey suspending operations      and facing investigations
   * Turkey is still a 2nd tier economy. They need mining companies for their economic stability and these companies are deeply tied to the political class
* Currently  under a class action lawsuit regarding potential securities fraud

**The negative event has created a tremendous discount in the share price of  SSRM**

**SSR Mining made $1.43 billion in revenue** for the twelve months ending December 31 2023. This showed a significant increase of 24.29% compared to their revenue in the previous year.

* **Gold:** Prices rose in 2023 with estimates suggesting an average of around $1800 per ounce. Currently gold is trading at around $2344 per ounce
* **Silver:** Silver averaged $23 per ounce in 2023. Silver is at $28 per ounce
* **Copper:** Copper prices might have averaged around $4.50 per pound in 2023. Copper is currently at $4.29 per pound

**SSR Mining promises at .07/quarter in divi**s plus continued share buy-backs. Last year they purchased under 1 million shares so the impact of that is minimal. **This year with a suppressed stock price it will be over 1 million and have more of an impact on EPS.**

**Technicals:**

After a full quarter of consolidation the stock broke the upper end of the channel. It is currently trading in the zone north of $4.73 where it saw little volume trade on its mega drop after the news about the √á√∂pler mine. Especially when the price is north of $5.63 it will have nowhere to go but up because all the pain baked in will be gone.

**Given the consistent rally in metals the tendency for gold to be a safe haven and the likely outcome of the company's next two quarters I am extremely bullish on the price from here.**

Most likely is it climbs into the lower end of the previous channel \~$9 with enough time. Less likely events would be a reversion to the prior channel and/or some kind of transaction that jolts the price.

**Position: Shares for a long-term hold calls for a short-term hold (60) days.**",7,8

2024-04-11 04:58:04,Listen up regards CPI lesson incoming,"Look all of these people on here don‚Äôt seem to understand how the CPI is bullshit and are saying how rare cuts are never gonna happen until 2025. But let me paint you a different picture.

Yes the CPI came in technically hotter than expected but when you actually dive into the numbers it tells a different story. The main 3 factors that are causing this higher than 2 percent inflation are 
1. Shelter
2. Electricity 
3. Transportation

Now we‚Äôll look at each individually:
1. Shelter: shelter is calculated on a ‚Äúrenters equivalent‚Äù bullshit term made up to try and fudge the numbers on what people actually pay but for this explanation it‚Äôs not that important. What IS important is the fact that shelter is a lagging indicator. When the interest rate hike takes effect most people don‚Äôt feel the immediate impact of this. Renters have to go through their lease period before rent is raised and like 80 percent of mortgages are fixed rates so most home owners don‚Äôt feel it either. So shelter being at around 6% is actually the effects of the rate hikes at least 12-18 months prior to this date.

2. Electricity: despite the price of natural gas coal and renewable energy all becoming significantly cheaper in the last 4 years energy prices are up. The only possible explanation to me is profiteering because there is no reason why with all three of these commodities being so low should electricity be this high. 

3. Transportation: despite its name one of its largest components is actually car insurance which has miraculously increased by like 20% yoy because of their ‚Äùfuture modeling‚Äù predicting higher costs to them which ended up being false. If you check Geico‚Äôs recent quarterly statement they said they actually had lower costs this year on average. So once again profiteering.

In the end keeping interest rates high is actually hurting the CPI more by keeping mortgages higher which then translates to higher shelter. Without these 3 CPI numbers (one of which is a. Lagging and b. Held higher with higher rates while the other two are from profiteering) inflation is already below 2 percent.

TLDR: fed keeping rates higher for no reason because the real data says otherwise ",0,67

Each craft will cost around 50 mil and the initial fleet will consist of 5 crafts 4 operational and 1 backup. They plan to put this craft to work running between 300 - 400 flights per year and generating an annual revenue of around $1.3 billion with a gross profit of $800 - $900 mil.

New Delta spaceship factory in Phoenix close to completion production on the Delta craft set to begin in the coming months.

2024-04-11 00:32:05,My bearish thesis on $META,"The stock is ripe for pull back. Somehow META has managed to stay off the radar in this rally. 

Litigation- The FTC wants to tighten an existing 2020 Facebook privacy settlement to ban profiting from minors' data and expand curbs on facial recognition technology. The agency has accused Meta of misleading parents about protections for children. The FTC also wants undo the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp claiming Meta illegally maintains a monopoly in ‚Äúpersonal social networking‚Äù. If these go through it will be a massive blow to the bottom line. Twitter is also suing Meta claiming Threads copied their business and trade secret theft we'll see how this plays out. Lets also mention the never ending regulatory fines and litigation with European agencies.  All these issues are a serious liability for the company.

The competition- The single biggest threat to Meta is TikTok. The reason they are lobbying so hard to get it banned. People migrate to the next big thing older generations dont like change so i fully expect them to stay with Facebook until the end but the smart money saw whats happening with TikTok how fast its taken over the younger generation and they want it all of it. Steven Mnuchin is a smart man he knows at the current rate of TikToks growth its going to overtake Facebook and Instagram within the next 2-3 years. Its in a hyper growth stage and Meta has simply stalled out. 

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/14/former-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-is-putting-together-an-investor-group-to-buy-tiktok.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/14/former-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-is-putting-together-an-investor-group-to-buy-tiktok.html)

TikTok is also launching a direct competitor to Instagram and WhatsApp very soon. Those users 35 and under  currently on Insta will easily migrate over to the newest thing. There is no loyalty to a service or app. If you are spending most of your time already watching tiktok you can easily switch over to Notes no need to go back to Instagram if all your friend are posting videospictures and chatting on TikTok. More time spent on Tiktok less time on Meta apps. 

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/04/09/tiktok-is-testing-a-new-instagram-rival-are-photos-making-a-comeback/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/04/09/tiktok-is-testing-a-new-instagram-rival-are-photos-making-a-comeback/)

&#x200B;

The presidential election- The Presidential ad spending is always massive and grows each year but its very limited. Only 28.1 percent goes to digital marketing most goes toward tv ads not small facebook google and newspaper ads.

AI - Meta announced their AI plans even making their own chips or designing their own chips. This seems like a last ditch effort to stay relevant and a costly venture like the metaverse. I don't see what meta could do with AI other than mine peoples data more efficiently and sell it. Picture and video AI is limited there's so many third party apps that can do it better. 

Meta is running out of ideas the company has peaked we may start to see declining revenue and user activity year after year. The balance of influence is shifting. Meta had its run time to join Myspace. 

lastly the dividend another effort to keep investors around. You can get a higher yield and take less risk holding a treasury bond. ",0,35

2024-04-10 21:24:27,More uneccessary whining & complaining,"Good evening.

I see a lot of regards whining and complaining about today's CPI report and apparently the American heroes who work on Wall Street have decided to shit themselves because bears who hate America are saying that inflation is too high. Yeah the 3.5% CPI came in higher than expected. Still inflation hasn't declined this fast since the late 1940s. And consider what is beneath the surface:

[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) 

Food prices went from 0.0% in Feb to 0.1% in March and still remain lower than they were during Q4 of 2023 AND where food prices were in the months prior to the pandemic. On top of that food at home costs didn't increase so the minor increase was at restaurants. 

Energy inflation came in hot in February after actually declining in January it cooled off this month from 2.3% to 1.1%. This was driven by an increase in electricity prices; energy services saw a slight decline & utility services decline significantly from 2.3% in February to 0.0% in March.

Commodity & energy commodity prices DECLINED in March as they did in January. 

Shelter remained the same and is lower than it was in January & September of 2023. 

Medical care services increased slightly from 0.3% to 0.5%.

&#x200B;

Other changes:

\-Prices of bakery items cereal pasta and rice declined MoM

\-Meat prices did increase modestly

\-Egg prices went up dramatically so I guess the poors will be complaining about $8 egg prices again soon

\-Sugar prices declined (Yay for LLY?) 

\-Butter prices saw a significant decline (Yay for LLY & NVO? Even VTRS?)

\-Soup & snack prices declined 

\-Appliance prices declined

\-Housekeeping product prices declined

\-Elderly care prices increased by a lot

&#x200B;

It seems to be a very mixed report once you dive into the details it's not that bearish really. It's regarded to think this means inflation will remain out of control. If this were 1984 when we had average inflation of 3.9% and GDP growth of around 7% we'd be thrilled. But everyone likes to complain today.

Wanna make ez money? Well TSMC‚Äôs earnings report on the 18th is gonna be a very noice 8-15% jump on their stock price. I was waiting to put this out until after April 10th because of the Monthly Earnings which might have been impacted by the earthquake but all is still good according to them so here we go.

 

\-----Revenue-----

1st quarter revenue is crazy good.

January up 7.9%        Y-o-Y

February up 11.3%   Y-o-Y

March up 34.3%        Y-o-Y

March 2023 was pretty bad last year but she stepped up big time this year with some very nice Y-o-Y gains.

https://preview.redd.it/wz2ovevnvptc1.jpg?width=679&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd3870d6e46d62acadea97671aae62ff8afcd370

In the March 2024 Revenue Report listed above January to March revenue is up 16.5% Y-o-Y very good  Y-o-Y gain for a company of TSMC‚Äôs size.

It gets better though. 

Looking at 1Q24 guidance from the Q423 earnings report revenue was estimated to be between 18 - 18.8 billion dollars.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x3puidx2wptc1.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65cd7f1d7db65312681663f9b1048bfa12431280

Using the above guidance and converting  NT$ to US$ we get about 18.4 billion dollars for January to March revenue for 2024 pretty much right in line with the guidance. I don't have all the info on other more boring stuff but from what I see we are pretty solid right now for the revenue numbers.

&#x200B;

\-----EPS-----

 

Is TSMC going to beat the expected/forecasted EPS ?

Absolutely.

If we look at the numbers from last years expected Q1 2023 eps of 1.21 it was beat with an actual EPS of 1.3 and that's with a pretty bad march 2023. And if you remember this March we have a 34% increase Y-o-Y AND a 7.5% M-o-M increase from February. It's looking very good so far.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k4r3a1mlwptc1.png?width=226&format=png&auto=webp&s=01d7fd0e12ed8b7a0243290ef47cde2a94764f4c

&#x200B;

The forecasted EPS is around 1.29 - 1.3 right now.

In Q1 2023 the EPS estimate was beat by around 8.2%

With a 16.5% Y-o-Y increase in revenue for January to Marchand only a 6.6% increase in estimated EPS Im guesstimating a surprise EPS of around 1.4 - 1.45  beating estimates by 8.5 - 12%.

&#x200B;

 \-----STONK PRICE-----

How much of a jump am I thinking in the stock price?

Over 10%

Recently Q4 of 2023 had a surprise EPS beat of 5.11% and the stock price jumped from around $100 to $110 over the course of a day. With a better EPS surprise I think we can rally around 8-15% over a day or 2 with the ai hype train going on and the expected 20% growth for TSMC estimated this year by themselves.

&#x200B;

Below are my positions mostly ITM calls that have gone up over the past 2 weeks:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 TLDR: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE but if you want to buy 150  thru 160 calls you should make a pretty   
decent profit 170 if you are feeling ballzy

I‚Äôve been diving deep into the options market and found what seems to be an overlooked opportunity with SWAV (Shockwave Medical Inc.). After Johnson & Johnson announced acquiring SWAV for about $12.5-$13.1 billion setting each share price at $335 it‚Äôs intriguing to see SWAV‚Äôs shares hovering around $328-$329  .

This situation seems particularly interesting for the 4/19 $330 calls. Considering the acquisition price and SWAV‚Äôs current trading price these calls appear to be trading at a bargain. Currently up 325% today with just an increase of 0.7% in the stock price. With just a slight uptick of 1-2% these options could see significant gains.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20240320.pdf

Provided by ChatGPT: 

The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 19-20 2024 reveal a cautious outlook on the economy and inflation in response to recent economic developments including higher Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures.

Key highlights from the minutes include:

- Economic Growth and Labor Market: The U.S. economy was expanding at a solid pace albeit slower than in the previous quarter. The labor market remained strong with demand and supply moving into better balance even though certain sectors and areas reported very tight conditions. The committee noted strong payroll growth and low unemployment rates alongside signs of easing labor market conditions such as declining job vacancies and a lower quits rate.

- Inflation Concerns: The committee observed significant progress towards the 2 percent inflation objective yet recent months showed firmer than expected inflation readings indicating a more complex disinflation process. The persistence of high inflation and its adverse effects on households were highlighted along with a broad-based increase in recent inflation readings.

- Monetary Policy Stance: All participants agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¬º to 5¬Ω percent citing it as supportive of progress towards returning inflation to the 2 percent objective. The stance on monetary policy was deemed likely at its peak for this tightening cycle with most participants anticipating a move to a less restrictive stance within the year if the economy evolved as expected. Nonetheless the committee stressed the need for further confidence that inflation was sustainably moving towards the 2 percent target before considering rate reductions.

- Risks and Uncertainties: There was considerable discussion around the uncertainties and risks facing the economy including geopolitical risks financial conditions productivity growth and the impact of recent immigration trends on labor supply and economic activity. The balance of risks to the employment and inflation goals was seen as moving into better balance although careful monitoring of incoming data and a readiness to adjust policy as needed were emphasized.

In summary the FOMC minutes reflect a cautious but hopeful outlook on the economy with particular attention to the challenges of managing inflation back to the 2 percent target. The committee's decision to maintain the current federal funds rate range underscores its commitment to stabilizing prices while being ready to adapt its policy stance in response to new economic data.",17,8

&#x200B;

The announcement came just one day after Intel (INTC) unveiled its Gaudi 3 accelerator for enterprise gen AI. Coincidentally on the same day Alphabet's Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) showcased its latest in-house chips Axion to help the tech giant address rising computing costs handle more AI-related workloads and cut its reliance on outside vendors such as Nvidia (NVDA).

&#x200B;

Social media titan Meta's latest generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator MTIA designed for AI-workloads are intended to power its ranking and recommendation ads models.

&#x200B;

""As AI workloads become increasingly important to our products and services this efficiency will improve our ability to provide the best experiences for our users around the world"" the company said.

&#x200B;

The latest MTIA more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth of its predecessor which was released last year.

&#x200B;

""To support the next-generation silicon we have developed a large rack-based system that holds up to 72 accelerators"" Meta said. ""We specifically designed the system so that we could clock the chip at 1.35GHz (up from 800 MHz) and run it at 90 watts compared to 25 watts for our first-generation design.""

&#x200B;

Meta also updated the software stack PyTorch associated with the upgraded MTIA chips. The company also created Triton an open source language and compiler for writing highly efficient ML compute kernels to maximize hardware utilization.

&#x200B;

""We currently have several programs underway aimed at expanding the scope of MTIA including support for GenAI workloads"" Meta added.

2024-04-10 16:17:56,Pools Closed: Why LESL is Circling the Drain,"What was your first thought when you read Joann Fabrics went bankrupt?  If you're like me it was: ""Holy shit I can't believe they weren't bankrupt 10 years ago.""  I started looking for similarly situated companies that the market hasn't finished off yet and it lead me to Leslie Inc.

There are a lot of parallels between LESL and Joanne:  Both are primarily legacy brick and mortar stores serving an aging clientele and both are (or were) extremely vulnerable to ecommerce and shifting consumer trends.  I could justify shorting the absolute shit out of LESL on its fundamentals alone.  Negative equity bad loan terms and no line of sight to enough profitability to get out from under it.  They're not even a realistic acquisition target due to their bylaws.  All of that is readily apparent in their annual report if you care to read it:  https://ir.lesliespool.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-24-014254/0001193125-24-014254.pdf

Speaking of their annual report: They lay a lot of blame for their poor performance on inclement weather.  It's literally been the hottest year in history and they sell pool stuff.  Not buying it.

LESL went public in 2020 and other than the initial honeymoon period it's been a sustained loser since.  Their IPO made some funds a lot of money but certainly didn't make them a better company.  Now with no relief from high interest rates and debt covenants that could restrain them from raising new money LESL is more vulnerable than ever.  

The vast majority of their existing equity is tied up in their inventories.  Not unusual but also not good news considering their house brands are overpriced and alternatives in the market place abound.  Based on my visits to a few of their stores it seems like they're sustained mostly by: 1) boomers who haven't heard of youtube and cannot figure out how a pool works; and 2) literally nobody else. I defy you to find a house brand they sell that is price competitive with the market.

The next generation of pool owners isn't going to pay a 40% mark-up to buy from a chain pool place (not when amazon exists and home depot sells a similar product cheaper).  Ecommerce is coming for them in a big way and LESL's enormous geographic footprint will end up being an albatross around its neck.  They have 46 stores alone in the tropical paradise of Pennsylvania.  Good luck paying all that rent.

The best time to short LESL was three years ago the second best time is now.  It's not HTB and short interest is relatively low considering how weak it is.  I am betting they're going to halve before the end of the year more if more people pay attention to it.

&#x200B;

The announcement made by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol also consists of a separate 1.4T won fund to support AI semiconductor companies the report added.

&#x200B;

By setting aside investments and a fund South Korea intends to expand research and development in AI chips such as artificial neural processing units or NPUs and next-generation high-bandwidth memory or HBM chips the government said as per the report.

&#x200B;

The country will also promote the development of next-generation artificial general intelligence or AGI and safety technologies which go beyond existing models.

&#x200B;

Yoon intends South Korea to become one of the top three countries in AI technology including chips and take a 10% or more share of the worldwide system semiconductor market by 2030 the report added.

&#x200B;

Semiconductors are vital to the Asian nation's export-driven economy. In March chip exports surged to their highest in 21 months at $11.7B or nearly a fifth of total exports shipped by the country according to the report.

&#x200B;

The U.S. is providing funding through its CHIPS Act which aims to increase U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and research especially in advanced semiconductors.

&#x200B;

Several companies are expected to get funds under the act with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) already having inked a deal for about $20B in grants and potential loans and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) signing an agreement for up to $6.6B in grants and as much as $5B in loans. Samsung Electronics (OTCPK:SSNLF) is expected to be awarded more than $6B.

2024-04-10 13:47:08,Tesla RoboTaxis vs Model 2: Which has more potential for Tesla?,"**What Happened:**¬†

Elon Musk‚Äôs latest claim on Twitter was to announce the [long-awaited Robotaxi reveal on August 8th](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/elon-musk-sets-date-for-tesla-s-robotaxi-debut-amid-controversy/ar-BB1liJmi) shooting the stock market up early 5% on Monday.¬†

This announcement was posted on X on Friday just after news broke from Reuters that Tesla planned to cancel the long-awaited sub-$30000 ‚ÄúModel 2‚Äù electric vehicle once again in order to focus on the launch of the robotaxi.¬†

Elon Musk was quoted responding on X saying that Reuters was ‚Äúlying (again)‚Äù even though this information came from a legitimate and trustworthy source within the EV company.

**Sides Are Split.**

Although Tesla's stock shot up Wall Street analysts are heavily mixed about the announcement:

**Bear Viewpoint:**

If the shift away from the Model 2 is confirmed some analysts believe that this would dramatically improve Tesla‚Äôs current position in the market. If the EV company is so optimistic on its improvements to its autonomous technology that it has decided to solely focus its efforts on releasing the robotaxi then many analysts see this as a major positive.

Tesla is often valued closer to a technology company than an automotive one and this development surely indicates this will continue to be true. The actual vehicle has never been Tesla‚Äôs main asset but its self-driving robotaxi network which is just now coming fully into focus is its main value driver. Very few automotive companies would be able to imitate this product which would give Tesla very favorable economics.

**Bull Viewpoint:**

On the other side many analysts believe Tesla has sacrificed a key portion of its business labeling the Model 2 as a volume play that would reaccelerate volume and demand for the company metrics that have really suffered in 2025.¬†

In order for features such as FSD or full self-driving to be as accurate as possible Tesla needs more data. To get more data the EV maker needs more cars on the road hence where the Model 2 comes in.

2024-04-10 12:23:15,NVDA - bottom not in,"I have been closely following NVIDIA (NVDA) for some time now. There are a couple of key events I'd like to highlight:

**Earnings**: NVDA did report strong earnings but the initial market reaction was a decline in the stock price suggesting the numbers weren't as impressive as the market had anticipated. Of course it took off as market shook off the numbers and continued to pile in. While NVDA achieved an impressive 80% margin amid strong growth high margins tend to attract competition which is something to watch out for going forward.

**GTC (NVIDIA's GPU Technology Conference)**: Despite all the hype around this event NVDA stock barely saw a bump in reaction. This was somewhat underwhelming given the importance of this conference.  

Overall I believe NVDA's stock has run up too far too fast. I expect it to pull back further towards the pre-earnings level of around $650 before the last earnings report. From there I think the stock could run back up to the $750-$800 range as earnings continue to impress but might struggle to justify prices above $900.

Given this outlook I'm taking a cautious stance and plan to stay on the sidelines until the stock hits around $650. At that point I'll reevaluate the market conditions and trade accordingly. For this quarter I'm laying off NVDA to see how things play out.",0,22

2024-04-10 09:54:17,CPI report to be published on Wednesday morning. Wallstreet expects little to No progress against inflation," 

A big report from the Labor Department is coming out soon and it‚Äôs expected to show that inflation‚Äîthe rising prices of goods and services‚Äîisn‚Äôt slowing down much. This news isn‚Äôt great for regular folks investors or even the government because they all want to see prices rise more slowly. If prices aren‚Äôt going down it might be harder for the Federal Reserve (the folks in charge of money stuff) to lower interest rates later this year which can affect how much you pay for things like loans.

The report looks at something called the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which basically tracks how much stuff costs in the economy. It‚Äôs predicted that both the overall CPI and a version that doesn‚Äôt include the prices of food and energy will go up by about 0.3%. That means on average prices are expected to increase by 3.4% and 3.7% respectively over the year. These numbers are higher than what the government ideally wants which is around a 2% increase.

Experts like Dan North who‚Äôs a senior economist don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre making enough progress to get inflation down to that 2% target. The report is due to come out at 8:30 a.m. ET and it‚Äôs likely to show that we‚Äôre still far from reaching that goal.

Although inflation has come down from its peak in June 2022 when prices were rising more than 9% progress has been slow lately. Even though the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023 to try to slow down inflation it hasn‚Äôt made a huge difference. Prices haven‚Äôt changed much since they stopped raising rates though some measurements show a slight improvement.

Aside from the Labor Department report the Federal Reserve keeps an eye on another indicator called the personal consumption expenditures index (PCE). In February it showed inflation at 2.5% overall and 2.8% if you leave out food and energy prices. This indicates that inflation is still a concern.

People who invest in the stock market are getting nervous too. Even though stocks did well at the start of the year they‚Äôve been up and down recently because investors aren‚Äôt sure what to make of all this conflicting information.

Earlier this year some investors thought the Federal Reserve would start lowering interest rates as soon as March and might keep doing it until 2024 making up to seven cuts. However now it looks like any cuts might not happen until at least June and there might be only up to three cuts each just a small amount according to calculations from the CME Group.

TSM ‚Äî which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies including Apple (AAPL) Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) ‚Äî saw first-quarter revenue of NT$592.64B (about $18.54B) compared to NT$508.63B ($16.72B) in the same period a year ago.



For the first quarter of 2024 TSM had forecast revenue to be between $18B and $18.8B the company had said during its fourth-quarter earnings in January. The Consensus Revenue Estimate for the first quarter is $18.06B.



The quarterly figures beat LSEG SmartEstimate of NT$581.45 according to a report from Reuters.



TSM's revenue for March 2024 surged 34.3% year-over-year to NT$195.21B while it grew 7.5% month-over-month (NT$181.65B in February).



The company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on April 18.

2024-04-10 08:11:36,Shari Anti-Fiduciary Redstone (A Corporate Governance Case Study: How Management Can Legally Raw Dog You For Half a Decade),"How Shari Redstone has destroyed a media company making even the most patient of value investors \[Berkshire Hathaway\] run for the hills:

**Building the Empire**: Media mogul Sumner Redstone rose to prominence by building Viacom into a giant encompassing powerhouses like MTV Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures. National Amusements (NAI) a holding company controlled by the Redstone family was the key player behind this growth. In 2000 NAI further expanded its media reach by acquiring CBS for Viacom.

**The Split (2006)**: Just seven years later in a move that surprised many Sumner decided to de-merge Viacom and CBS. This unexpected decision sparked questions about his motives and potential disagreements with CBS leadership. Reports also surfaced that Verizon a major telecommunications company expressed interest in acquiring CBS around this time. However these talks never materialized.

**Enter Shari Redstone**: Sumner's daughter Shari Redstone a lawyer by profession became increasingly involved in the family business particularly NAI's holdings in Viacom and CBS. She disagreed with the de-merger believing that a combined Viacom and CBS would be a stronger competitor in the evolving media landscape and could be sold for more together rather than separate.

**Conflict and Lawsuits**: As Sumner's health and mental capacity declined a series of lawsuits erupted centered on control of NAI and its holdings in Viacom and CBS. Shari clashed with Sumner's confidantes including Philippe Dauman CEO of Viacom and Manuela Hernandez Sumner's girlfriend.

**Shari vs. The Confidantes**: Shari suspected these confidantes were manipulating her father who was in his 80s and allegedly experiencing health issues. She made serious allegations claiming they were influencing his decisions including the Viacom/CBS split his control of NAI and his healthcare for their own benefit. The most sensational allegation centered around Sumner's mental capacity and Hernandez's influence. Shari claimed Hernandez was manipulating Sumner and even hired prostitutes for him.

**Legal Battles and Public Scrutiny**: Shari filed lawsuits to gain control of NAI which ultimately determined who would have voting power in Viacom and CBS. These lawsuits became very public and exposed the explosive allegations about Sumner's mental state and the influence of his confidantes.

**Shari's Tyranny Begins**: The legal battles were ultimately settled. Shari emerged victorious gaining control of NAI and its voting shares in Viacom and CBS. This effectively gave her the power to reunite Viacom and CBS which she had always advocated for.

**Shari's First Violation of ""Fiduciary""**: Verizon Communications Inc. was interested in buying CBS Corp. before merger discussions between Viacom Inc. and CBS heated up unnamed sources told Deadline. Citing a court filing Deadline reported May 14 that CBS disclosed the interest of another would-be acquirer but Shari Redstone who controls CBS through her family-owned National Amusements Inc. discouraged the potential bidder from proposing a deal. Verizon was reportedly engaged in high-level talks with CBS last year but it is unclear how far the talks progressed.

CBS earlier sued National Amusements which holds nearly 80% of the voting stock in both CBS and Viacom accusing it of breaching its fiduciary duty. The lawsuit also requested the court to block National Amusements from interfering with a special meeting of the board of directors at which the directors will consider declaring a dividend that would significantly dilute National Amusements' voting power in CBS. Specifically the directors are looking at declaring a dividend of class A common stock to all of the company's class A and class B stockholders. If issued the dividend would dilute National Amusements' voting interest to 17%. CBS said this move would enable the company to operate as an independent non-controlled company and more fully evaluate strategic alternatives.

**ViacomCBS Merger**: Against all shareholder desires in 2019 Viacom and CBS finally merged creating ViacomCBS (now known as Paramount Global). Mario Gabelli considered suing Viacom over the merger while a multiyear lawsuit ensued between CBS and Shari Redstone. The settlement was eventually reached.

**Streaming Wars**: Despite Wall Streets wishes for Paramount Global to become an arms dealer in the streaming wars Shari Redstone forced Paramount Global to invest billions in a speculative streaming service.

**Value Investors**: Many value investors were attracted to the valuable assets Paramount Global owns on one of which is the crown jewel Paramount Pictures estimated to be worth $30000000000 by Steven Cahall: ""At 5x EV/Licensing for Paramount Studios (since we're now in higher cost of capital times) PARA's studios are worth \~$30bn""

**Skydance Merger**: Recent leaks reveal a highly dilutive merger between Paramount Global and Skydance which involves a two step transaction.

Skydance bails out the pandemic- induced financially troubled NAI for $2 Billion cash

Merge Skydance into Paramount Global and issue $5 Billion in equity

**Minority Shareholder Dissent**: big money such as Matrix Asset Advisors have blasted the board for entertaining while rejecting a $30 Billion bid from Byron Allen and $26 Billion bid from Apollo Asset Management -- following up with threats of lawsuits. Even small regards from reddit are spamming the investor relations.

If it isn't obvious this deal clearly favors Shari Redstone over all investors.

Bailing out NAI shouldn't even be relevant to the merger

The equity given to Skydance in the proposed merger is highly dillutive which would be lower if not the $2 Billion cash payment to NAI -- remember cash is not always a 1 to 1 match in equity.

Shari Redstone's history of violating fiduciary responsibility continues as she currently positions NAI (a clear conflict of interest) between any potential M&A deal to unlock ""shareholder value"".

It is a shame to see a company like PARA sit one tremendously valuable assets yet the stock plummet 80% from ATH.

History may not repeat itself but it sure rhymes.

p.s. If you wonder why Berkshire sold during the rally in Q4 2023 the bid from Apollo and Byron estimate the B shares right around his exit price of $16-$17 per share.",11,9

2024-04-10 02:21:35,Depressing Story to Figure out,So I don‚Äôt really like Reddit and I have concerns with r/wallstreetbets (you guys are fucking disturbing to watch) but there was this company I was going to meme post here as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù investment I made into them as I thought they were simply ‚Äúbad‚Äù (balance sheet and financial statements looked a little embarrassing initially) but I went to their website and did a little bit of digging and I can only say that I feel a bit bad for the owner of it and the workers too. The company I‚Äôm talking about is ‚ÄúGreenwave Technology solutions.‚Äù At first I was going to make a bait thread where I fucking edited the price of the stock out and only showed how many shares I owned and once you guys searched up the ticker symbol you‚Äôd fucking laugh your asses off or something lol. But while I was reading their financial statements I did get a bit curious about them they had less than 10 thousand dollars in net revenues a couple years back and were taking some serious financial losses even then. It didn‚Äôt help when Covid came in and slammed into their bottom-line. I found out it got so bad that apparently the owner this guy named ‚ÄúDanny W. Meeks‚Äù was an alderman in the Portsmouth city council. When his business needed him though he resigned (fucking respect). Which is something that most politicians really don‚Äôt do especially when shit hits the fan so yeah I respected that a lot. The company is a small business it‚Äôs so fucking small that I didn‚Äôt even know a company like this one could be traded on the stock market neither did the nasdaq because they unironically tried to delist them thankfully the Meeks was able to postpone this by showing that the company could meet the ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù so now he has a 180 day long deadline apparently to bring the stock price up to 1 dollar I believe. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to fucking do it (even though there is a little bit of volatility in the companies history). This isn‚Äôt financial advice but I hope they do. I might invest a small portion of my portfolio/paycheck into this company over time just to support small business. I feel fucking bad for this dude it‚Äôs not an easy thing to do especially after corona.

One of the issues is that people tend to get very emotional when discussing Boeing and that's a problem in itself. But in the short to medium term Boeing will also be suffering from some significant cash flow challenges:

1. Defense Business: Boeing is working through some very poor defense contracts. These will roll off in the coming years but defense margins remain very poor in the meantime.
2. Commercial Business: Boeing has had to deal with poor contracts from the COVID-19 pandemic unproductive production lines and inventory issues. The news flow doesn't help and it's possible they may not get back to full production until next year.
3. Services Business: This part of the business is doing fine but how long can it support the two money-losing segments?

The underlying value is there but these fundamental cash flow issues go beyond just the negative news. In the next 3-6 months I believe Boeing is a bad buy.

The stock should benefit from a reset but that will be difficult given Boeing's semi-governmental status and the politics they have to manage. It's essentially a value trap right now. I think it's a screaming buy once they work through these problems but not yet.  Stay away!",481,212

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) hugged the flatline while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) edged up about 0.3%. The benchmark S&P 500 (GSPC) climbed more than 0.1%.

2024-04-09 19:53:45,This is why Boeing puts next week could provide a great payout next week.,"Alright all this is going to be DD on the short side but still juicy.

So today it came to light that the FAA is investigating Boeing not because of additional issues related to the 737 Max but rather due to a whistleblower coming forth and raising concerns about the 787 Dreamliner AND the 777 where not only does the whistleblower claim that Boeing took shortcuts but that he was also retaliated against for raising the issues.

But let's say that you knew that already. So why could puts be the strategy for next week? Because next week Boeing will be testifying in front of congress (well a subcommittee in the Senate but still!). They will be asked about all of the issues that have popped up with the 737 for the past few years and now also the reports regarding the 787 and 777. There is absolutely no good news that can come out next week to redeem them short of another company purchasing Boeing and that is almost impossible to happen as Boeing itself is at no risk of being in financial trouble any time soon even with all the issues they have. While there have been plenty of negative news coming out for Boeing lately we are guaranteed that no positive news can come out any time soon and as we all know the market loves to react to news.

TL;DR: Puts on Boeing for next week because finance bros ruined the company.",10,28

2024-04-09 18:40:44,Looking For The Play For The Upcoming Milk Shortage,"As it stands bird flu (H5N1 avian influenza) is making its way across the world. Yet another coronavirus ([animal origin to humans](https://theconversation.com/a-person-in-texas-caught-bird-flu-after-mixing-with-dairy-cattle-should-we-be-worried-227223)) that we know very little about and certainly not enough to stop it.

Current situation:

&#x200B;

[Bird flu in chickens](https://preview.redd.it/y6try66yhhtc1.jpg?width=2059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fadc612737765bc87b4d9e474816a898720a4d59)

&#x200B;

[Bird flu in cattle](https://preview.redd.it/pxlmchs0ihtc1.jpg?width=1398&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7cef35b3f35bf6183e5d13ec7a093746ab1c4ad8)

The first map is meaningless. Everyone is going to hoard chicken chicken nuggets and eggs but they're wasting their time.

When it comes to chicken that industry can take a major hit keep walking and laugh it off. The chicken and egg industry is impervious to issues. They have that shit on lock down.

When it comes to meat that you consume it's down to ""egg to your plate"" in 28 days. If the birds weren't ""harvested"" at this point their legs would snap under their own weight. They're fatter than ever but their bone structure hasn't changed to adapt to it.

When it comes to eggs billions of chickens are laying them daily at peak every 16 hours. Eggs last forever the meat gets wasted because there's so much of it (typically turned to cat/dog food) and because of the genetic changes they grow faster than ever.

You can wipe out 80% of the poultry population and not even slow it down.

# How do I know this?

3 million miles as a truck driver has taught me plenty about many different industries.

The one that matters here is live chickens.

The highest value and lowest value loads I've hauled were both chickens.

Ever wonder what $8200000 worth of chickens look like?

Feast your eyes on this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3titj0f0khtc1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6cd7baeb7d3894554dd278b29603db3347e1f2f9

8200 chickens worth $1000 each. They had to move a fence to get me to the barn 2 veterinarians watched the crew load and unload them I was escorted down the highway blew through every toll and wasn't allowed to stop. I moved 2 loads between the two barns that week. Final total was $16500000 worth of chickens 4500 miles and about 14 gallons of coffee/day.

(Humble brag: As long as drivers like me exist supply will never grind to a halt. We got your back. Fuck a log book! I used 3 and know how to fuck with the new electronic ones. Also never touched a drug in my life.)

These are your purebred chickens that lay the eggs that become your breeder hens that lay your meat hens and egg layers. As long as the purebreds are kept secluded (which they always will be) the poultry industry is fine.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ijxydf37vhtc1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=320935df12c355485139c5e06ea560209f11be13

I've also hauled chickens after they've laid eggs for 2 years. 10000 of them get loaded onto the trailer and regardless of the weather it was a straight shot until they ended up in Brampton ON and get ground into a paste. From there they get turned into chicken wieners and sold to Russia. There's not a chance in fuck they'ld ever get sold as food in North America. These load values were $0.01/pd (entire loads were worth about $500).

# There won't be a shortage of chicken meat or eggs. Don't waste your time trying to find the play.

&#x200B;

Let's discuss beef for a second.

Beef can take a hit and get substituted with pork or chicken for a while and we'll be fine. Also of all the mafia ridden shit going beef is definitely it.

There are three loads that border security WILL NOT open in view of the public.

\- feminine hygiene products

\- alcohol (and related adult beverages)

\- frozen meat

&#x200B;

If they did you can bet your ass that driver is about to get robbed at gunpoint or killed in their bunk while they sleep for the load.

On the other hand it's abundant. 

Being Canadian we have 2 problems up here when it comes to beef;

\- We have way too much of it ([In 2022 Canada produced 3.61 billion pounds of beef and exported 49% of it](https://canadabeef.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/CBEEF-fast-fact-sheet-2023.pdf))

\- [Three meat-packing plants turn out 85% of Canada‚Äôs beef](https://financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/why-only-three-meat-packing-plants-process-the-vast-majority-of-canadas-beef)

There is a takeaway from the second point. When it comes to recalls due to e. coli in beef 1/3 of all Canadian beef goes straight into the trash and we hardly flinch.

Final point:

Who is the No 1 beef exporter in world?  
Brazil  
**Brazil** was the biggest exporter of beef in 2023 followed by India which exports water buffalo the United States and Australia. Mar 5 2024

&#x200B;

# This is also not the play.

&#x200B;

Ok so what is the play?

# MILK

&#x200B;

This shit is more addictive and in shorter supply than crack in the hood.

You can live without eggs and meat for a while but you can't disrupt milk. 

The substitutions are too few and the human meat sack depends on it.

\- school milk programs

\- cheese production

\- butter

\- ice cream

\- yogurt

&#x200B;

You might think that because it's pasteurized that it doesn't matter.

This is where you're wrong.

""In the barn"" means ""in the workers"".

The industries that interact with your milk on a daily basis is almost mind boggling to most. 

Let's visualize that journey:

\- It starts at the feed mill.

\- Then it's a truck driver.

\- The farm hand/farmer at the barn.

\- Another driver who collects the milk.

\- A dock worker.

\- People inside the processing plant packaging the milk.

\- Another truck driver.

\- The person stocking the shelves.

&#x200B;

Whether you realize it or not that's 50+ people.

Thinking that antibiotics are in milk is ludicrous as well. They're definitely in the cow but not a chance they're in the milk.

If a cow gets sick they produce way less milk.

The following is a monetary problem. If she's sick for a while she'll be put down and replaced. If this happens on masse the farmer is looking at bankruptcy in a matter of months. They make pennies in the end. It's time vs. money.

[The last time this happened they couldn't total the losses across the industry.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/dairy-milk-pandemic-supply-chains-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic/)

&#x200B;

This should be enough information to get the thought train rolling. The coming milk shortage is the play but I want to make enough out of it to hang up the keys on a 3 million mile career.

&#x200B;

# There's definitely one play here that will outweigh anything else. I want to know what it is.

&#x200B;

Also... why are your weight limits so fucking low in the US?

&#x200B;

2024-04-09 17:49:22,VST the Texas Energy Company just keeps defying gravity,"**Vistra Corp (VST)**

I think it took a real rise because of the [WSJ article](https://archive.ph/A5WHE) back at the end of March about VST being an AI stock and this thing looks more like NVDA every day. I call it my poor man's NVDA. Maybe my fellow smooth brains might see it too? This Texas based integrated retail electricity and power generation company is just on a tear this year. It has a focus on low and no carbon emission generation. They are pushing the boundaries towards a sustainable future; not just doubling down on fossil fuels while green washing with a dabbling in renewables. Even though this has increased from $38 to $70 as of this writing I still think it's a sleeper hit in your investment portfolio especially with the AI boom printing money. AI data centers need energy like they need NVDA chips. All part of the shovels to gold miners metaphor.

**AI Boom and Energy Sector Synergy:** The artificial intelligence revolution is set to spike electricity demand with Vistra well-positioned to benefit. Investments in data centers nearshoring of manufacturing and electrification of transportation are projected to push electricity demand growth with a CAGR of 13-15% through 2030 for data center electricity demand alone‚Äã ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vistra-corp-vst-announces-strong-123237528.html))‚Äã‚Äã ([Vistra Corp.

**Market Potential:**

* **Stock Performance:** Vistra's stock has already seen an impressive 85% increase year to date attributed in part to the AI-driven demand for electricity‚Äã ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vistra-corp-vst-announces-strong-123237528.html))‚Äã.
* **Power Demand Tailwinds:** Companies that are net long power like Vistra stand to gain as power demand escalates‚Äã ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vistra-corp-vst-announces-strong-123237528.html))‚Äã.

**Risks and Considerations:** Undeniable growth doesn't mean undeniable rise in stock price. This is not financial advice and I have a bias to make this more popular. 

**Technical Analysis:** For what it's worth the basic technicals are showing a slight pause and reversal to the 50 day SMA but still quite a bit above it. It's currently right in the middle of a Keltner channel but not below it enough to use the scalping tactic. So for any day trading or swing trading approach I'd say just watch it for a better opening. Since this acts more like NVDA then maybe waiting to jump in is just going to make it more expensive for you. 

**Conclusion:** Vistra Corp (VST) presents a compelling investment opportunity especially for those looking to leverage the burgeoning demand for electricity driven by the AI boom. With solid financials strategic growth initiatives and a strong foothold in clean energy Vistra is not just navigating the transition to a zero-carbon future; it's leading the charge. As the energy sector becomes increasingly critical in the AI era Vistra's unique position could make it a standout choice for investors seeking growth and sustainability.

Vistra offers a blend of innovation sustainability and financial savvy that could pay dividends in the AI-driven future.

*My bias: I hold stock and have long call positions. I am long on 165 contracts @ $1 for 4/19 exp $75 calls which has a realistic possibility of the underlying going to $80 by expiration and being worth $66K profit. So yeah I'd love nothing more than to see this rise. Today took a negative swing that might be a good opening as I opened 75% of my current position this morning as it took a major dump.* ",9,11

2024-04-09 17:19:43,How to Profiteer off of War A Brief,"The war between Russia in Ukraine is bad for those people... But there is money to be made.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time that is 1000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal is likely understated is of long duration and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well obviously the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities so IDGAF. Oil refining companies though DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/)

To be clear the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges boats pipes and asshole. However if the war ends this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown Baton Rouge Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining marketing and transportation company headquartered in Findlay Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA sticking with that for at least several years or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up MRO is up and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second if the war ends Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

Either or both of these rise us up to above a 10 bagger on our puts IMO. This shit would spike up so quick. If these scenarios occur sell on the volatility.

2024-04-09 16:23:05,Cybersecurity - buy the winners,"Cybersecurity remains one of the fastest growing industries. However it is also a very fragmented space. After a big pullback due to Palo Alto Networks (PANW) reporting disappointing results the whole sector took a dump and then has traded in a narrow range trending down slightly in the last month. This has created an interesting buying opportunity if you pick the right names.

First a little history lesson on PANW's earnings call that turned the tide. In its FY23 report PANW unveiled a ""new platformization strategy"" - essentially bundling products which is a trend we've seen across various industries (Progressive to FedEx). However the results so far have been underwhelming with PANW seeing a significant decceleration. Then more recently in its Q2 results PANW cited ""demand fatigue"" to justify a significant deceleration in its own product sales. This in turn had a negative impact on its cybersecurity peers.

The reality check:

1. The ""demand fatigue"" narrative was not borne out as peers like ZS CRWD continued to grow at 30%+ clip while PANW guides for just 2-4% growth.
2. The price action initially was correlated but has now started to diverge as active investors shift dollars from PANW to other players they believe will win. Given PANW's brand recognition I suspect we'll see more allocation from sidelines than a shift from PANW.

Key names to consider:

1. CRWD: Crowded trade higher risk. Hold.
2. PANW: Thrown all the bad news price action reversing. A ""must own"" cybersecurity stock also bought by Nancy Pelosi. Buy.
3. ZS: Had a good but not great quarter. Historically ZS beats sales by 5% but the beat was only 3%. Stock has traded sideways but on top of larger Fed deals Zscaler is poised to recover towards $240 as it beats earnings. Hot buy.
4. FTNT: Appears cheap but not in the same league. Sold off after a recent cyber event. Sell if you own it.

Overall the cybersecurity space presents an interesting opportunity but pick the right names. ZS is my top pick. PANW next.  Skip the rest.",58,32

2024-04-09 15:40:02,YOLOing $30K into $BOWL options before earnings‚Äîbig announcement coming?,"**Imagine you and your buds could $200m by increasing your company's share price 35%. You have less than 2 years to do it. The bull market is in full effect. What do you do?** 

Enter Thomas Shannon:

[Who do you think you are? I AM!](https://preview.redd.it/bfqa60rd2htc1.png?width=378&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa93ee849b220408e776a8d4064b454767f61559)

This guy is the CEO of Bowlero a bowling company (lmfao) with an extremely financially overengineered and rather terrible balance sheet. **He also made $65 million in 2022** making him one of the top 25 highest paid CEOs! 

This guy likes making money and if Bowlero hits $17.5 he and his friends PAID. 

Look at this:

[So there is an earnout which means that if the stock price hits $17.5 for 10 days there will be17.5 \* 11M  = $200 fucking million for Shannon and other earnout beneficiaries. Who are these other beneficiaries?](https://preview.redd.it/wqiq1yfmxgtc1.png?width=2820&format=png&auto=webp&s=4041a017a6dabf2d6d13aae4c8c94d04ee8fd32f)

**Private Equity and Insider Involvement**

Atairos is a large PE firm that helped bring Bowlero to market through a SPAC. They own a TON of shares. It is my view that they want to get the share price much higher before cashing out. Likewise company insiders like Shannon own another 40% of shares. So it seems to me that there is a pretty aligned group of smart people with deep pockets who stand to benefit.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bf7ys4dk1htc1.png?width=446&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ca7684d6863a212419f736daf589bc29b77223

If these guys want to hold for the share price to go up float is effectively small...

**Adding Fuel to the Fire**

Bowlero has been buying back its own shares with major buyback programs! Its float is already small and they are aggressively trying to make it even smaller. They have even taken on debt to buy back shares at times:

[Let's just make our float a bit smaller...](https://preview.redd.it/9v157b3augtc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=8045d15cc37adf11f88a2e94f7a4bc0600784abf)

**Buyback Announcement Increases**

Pretty regularly on earnings calls management announces increases in the already sizabe buyback. Over the last two earnings calls this has resulted in big pops in the stock price. 

*I think this is mechanical due to short covering and spurred on by positive announcements. So even without the ""earnout conspiracy"" I think it's a reasonable bet to go long through earnings:*

[Last Quarter](https://preview.redd.it/lynsbspvygtc1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d0345c86cc10e6e0958d2349e19ddf54a1dda93)

And why have these spikes been so violent? Well Bowlero is highly shorted because as I said at the beginning it looks like a rather ridiculous company and isn't ""fundamentally valuable""‚Äîwhatever that means:

[Note: I am not sure of these numbers. I see lots of conflicting info. Someone help out?](https://preview.redd.it/nqfgmo9t1htc1.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3cfd46f9b8575aa9639f90d53d29906831d79df)

*Earnings are coming up in Early March‚Äîif they announce a buyback or great results or a dividend etc. things could get spicy.*

**TL;DR**

**You and your PE buddies can get $200m. You love money. You've made your float small. You're highly shorted. Massive incentive to get shares up to $17.5. Aren't you going to do something that makes it happen on earnings May 8 2024?**

YOLO:

2024-04-09 14:41:17,Have your boomer parents or uber started talking about NVDA AI? Is it time exit this ride.,"Preface this with I'm a big NVDA AI fan been on the AI train for years before this

2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE

I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.

Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.

EDIT: I just think it‚Äôs way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD QCOM ARM AMZN MSFT GOOG Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  

Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it‚Äôs very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the ‚Äústreet‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù pivots quickly.  

5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  

https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens it‚Äôs almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won‚Äôt have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it‚Äôll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order.",1420,405

2024-04-09 05:02:24,META Puts ($35K profit) into TSM Calls,"On April 4th I deposited $6K into my brokerage and used all of it to buy next day expiring $META puts. Within 2 hours and 45 minutes the entire market took a dump and I sold the position for $40.8K. 

Today I opened a $16K position into APR26 expiring $160.00 $TSM calls. I believe the fundamentals and performance for TSMC are top notch and have not changed. The earthquake in Taiwan has been confirmed to have had little impact to TSMC operations and should not effect forward looking statements in a considerable way. TSMC is also a unique company in that they report monthly revenue figures. This reporting is expected this Wednesday (4/9/24) and should give clear visibility into earnings which is currently scheduled for 4/18/24. 

The awarding of Biden's $6.6B U.S. production for TSMC's Arizona foundry is the icing on cake which I believe was not properly baked into the stock during today's trading session. Wanted to post here ahead of time as I've been seeing people only post after their exit. 

  
Note: I do not know when I will be selling out of the position. It maybe after the monthly revenue figures on Wednesday if we get a solid beat and the stock rallies. Since revenue figures are posted on a monthly basis the earnings report is primarily useful for the forecast. If the forecast is anything short of phenomenal I am expecting a sell the news moment which may not be worth the risk. Also important to note that Wednesday's CPI and FOMC meeting along with Thursday's PPI updates could result in meaningful updates so definitely trade with caution. Lastly I may or may not add more to this position as this week continues and will keep anyone interested updated! Good luck
